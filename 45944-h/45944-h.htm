<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>The Author, having received many letters
from young and interested readers, has decided
to acknowledge them in this way,
because feeble health and much work for
the publishers make it impossible to write a
separate reply to each gratifying epistle.</p>

<p>She also desires to freely acknowledge indebtedness
for much information regarding
Revolutionary times and incidents, to Bancroft
and Lossing; and for the routine at
West Point, to an article in Harper's Magazine
for July, 1887, entitled "Cadet Life at
West Point," by Charles King, U. S. A.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>The train, which for some hours had been
running very fast and too noisily to admit of
much conversation, suddenly slackened its speed,
and Lulu turned upon her father a bright, eager
look, as though some request were trembling on
her tongue.</p>

<p>"Well, daughter, what is it?" he asked, with
an indulgent smile, before she had time to utter
a word.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" she began in a quick, excited
way, and quite as if she expected her request
would be granted, "I know we're going through
New York State, and I've just been thinking
how much I would like to see Saratoga,&mdash;especially
the battle-field where the Americans gained
that splendid victory over the British in the Revolutionary
War."</p>

<p>"Ah! and would Max like it, too?" the Captain
asked, with a smiling glance at his son, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>sitting directly in front of them, had turned to
listen to their talk just as Lulu began her reply
to their father's query.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; yes, indeed!" Max answered eagerly,
his face growing very bright. "And you,
Papa, would you enjoy it, too?"</p>

<p>"I think I would," said the Captain, "though
it would not be for the first time; but showing
the places of interest to two such ardent young
patriots will more than compensate for that.&mdash;And
there have been changes since I was
there last," he continued, musingly. "Mount
McGregor, for instance, has become a spot of
historic interest. We will visit it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! where dear General Grant died,"
said Lulu. "I would like to go there."</p>

<p>"So you shall," returned her father. "This
is Friday; we shall reach Saratoga Saturday
night, should no accident detain us, spend Sunday
there resting, according to the commandment,
then Monday and Tuesday in sight-seeing."</p>

<p>"How nice, Papa," Lulu said with satisfaction.
"I only wish Mamma Vi and Gracie
could be there with us."</p>

<p>"It would double our pleasure," he replied.
"I think we must go again some time, when we
can have them along."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am glad to hear you say that, Papa!
for I am quite sure I shall enjoy going twice to
so interesting a place," said Lulu.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>"I, too," said Max. "I don't know of anything
that would please me better."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, and hope there will be
no disappointment to either of you," their father
said.</p>

<p>But the train was speeding on again, too fast
and too noisily for comfortable conversation,
and they relapsed into silence, the Captain returning
to his newspaper, Max to a book which
he seemed to find very interesting, while his sister
amused herself with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Lulu was feeling very happy; she had been
having so pleasant a summer out in the West
with Papa and Maxie, and was enjoying the
homeward journey,&mdash;or rather the trip to the
sea-shore, where the rest of the family were, and
where they all expected to remain till the end
of the season,&mdash;the prospect of seeing Saratoga
and its historical surroundings, and other places
of interest,&mdash;a view of which could be had
from the boat as they passed down the Hudson;
for she and Max had both expressed a preference
for that mode of travel, and their father
had kindly consented to let them have their
wish. She thought herself a very fortunate little
girl, and wished with all her heart that Gracie
could be there with them and share in all their
pleasures.</p>

<p>Dear Gracie! they had never been separated
for so long a time before, and Lulu was in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>haste for the meeting now that she could almost
be willing to resign the pleasure of a visit to
Saratoga that they might be together the sooner.
But no, oh, no, it would never do to miss a visit
there! It would defer their meeting only a day
or two, and she should have all the more to tell;
not to Gracie only, but to Evelyn Leland and
Rosie Travilla. Ah, how enjoyable that would
be! Oh, how full of pleasure life was now that
Papa was with them all the time, and they had
such a sweet home of their very own!</p>

<p>With that thought she turned toward him,
giving him a look of ardent affection.</p>

<p>He was still reading, but glanced from his
paper to her just in time to catch her loving
look.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he said, bending down to
speak close to her ear, and accompanying the
words with a smile full of fatherly affection.
"I fear you must be growing very weary with
this long journey," he added, putting an arm
about her and drawing her closer to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not so very, Papa!" she answered
brightly; "but I'll be ever so glad when we get
to Saratoga. Don't you think it will be quite a
rest to be out of the cars for a day or two?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I trust you will find them less
wearisome after your three days at Saratoga."</p>

<p>"What time shall we reach there, Papa?"
asked Max.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not long before your bed-time, I understand,"
replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"Then we cannot see anything before Monday?"</p>

<p>"You will see something of the town in walking
to church day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And we can start out bright and early on
Monday to visit places of interest," added Lulu;
"can't we, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will be careful to be ready in
good season. We want to see all we can in the
two days of our stay."</p>

<p>"And I don't believe we'll find Lu a hindrance,
as some girls would be," said Max.
"She's always prompt when anything is to be
done."</p>

<p>"I think that is quite true, Max," their father
remarked, looking from one to the other with a
smile that was full of paternal love and pride;
"and of you as well as of your sister."</p>

<p>"If we are, Papa, it is because you have
trained us to punctuality and promptness," returned
the lad, regarding his father with eyes
full of admiring filial affection.</p>

<p>"And because you have heeded the lessons I
have given you," added the Captain. "My dear
children, when I see that you are doing so, it
gives me a glad and thankful heart."</p>

<p>They reached Saratoga the next evening more
than an hour earlier than they had expected; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>as the moon was nearly full, they were, much to
the delight of Max and Lulu, able to wander
about the town for an hour or more after tea,
enjoying the sight of the beautiful grounds and
residences, and the crowds of people walking
and driving along the streets, or sitting in the
porches. They visited Congress Park also,
drank from its springs, strolled through its
porches out into the grounds, wandered along
the walks, and at length entered the pavilion.</p>

<p>Here they sat and rested for awhile; then the
Captain, consulting his watch, said to his children,
"It is nine o'clock, my dears; time that
tired travellers were seeking their nests."</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and taking Lulu's hand,
led the way, Max close in the rear.</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa, I'm tired enough to be very willing
to go to bed," said Lulu; "but I hope we
can come here again on Monday."</p>

<p>"I think it altogether likely we shall be able
to do so," he replied.</p>

<p>"If we are up early enough we might run
down here for a drink of the water before
breakfast on Monday," said Max. "Can't we,
Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all three of us," replied the Captain.
"Let us see who will be ready first."</p>

<p>They passed a quiet, restful Sabbath, very
much as it would have been spent at home;
then, on Monday morning, all three were up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>and dressed in season for a visit to some of the
nearer springs before breakfast.</p>

<p>They went to the Park together, took their
drinks, returned after but a few minutes spent
in the garden, breakfasted, and shortly after
leaving the table were in a carriage on their
way to Schuylerville.</p>

<p>They visited the battle-ground first, then the
place of surrender, with its interesting monument.</p>

<p>"We will look at the outside first," the Captain
said, as they drew near it. "It is called the
finest of its kind, and stands upon the crowning
height of Burgoyne's intrenched camp."</p>

<p>"I wonder how high it is," Max said inquiringly,
as they stood at some distance from the
base, he with his head thrown back, his eyes
fixed upon the top of the shaft.</p>

<p>"It is said to be more than four hundred and
fifty feet above the level of the river," replied
his father.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder if we couldn't see the battle-field
from the top!" exclaimed Lulu, excitedly.
"I suppose they'll let us climb up there, won't
they, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a consideration," returned the Captain,
smiling at her eager look; "but first let us
finish our survey of the outside."</p>

<p>"What kind of stone is this, sir?" asked
Max, pointing to the base.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>"Light granite," replied his father. "And
the shaft is of dark granite, rough hewn, as you
will notice."</p>

<p>"And there are gables," remarked Lulu,&mdash;"great
high ones."</p>

<p>"Yes; nearly forty feet high, and resting at
their bases upon granite eagles with folded
wings. Observe, too, the polished granite columns,
with carved capitals, which all the cornices
of doors and windows rest upon."</p>

<p>"And the niches over the doors," said Max,
still gazing upward as they walked slowly around
the shaft, "one empty I see, each of the others
with a statue in it. Oh, they are the generals
who commanded our troops in the battle!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father, "Generals Schuyler,
Morgan, and Gates,&mdash;who by the way was hardly
worthy of the honour, as he gave evidence of
cowardice, remaining two miles away from the
field of battle, all ready for a possible retreat,
while Burgoyne was in the thickest of the fight.
The fourth and empty one, do you not see, has
the name of Arnold carved underneath it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Arnold the traitor!" exclaimed
Max. "How <em>could</em> he turn against his country?
But, Papa, he did do good service in this battle
and some of the earlier ones, and it's such a
pity he turned traitor!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a very great pity!" assented the Captain,
heaving an involuntary sigh. "While detesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>his treachery, I have always felt that he
has not received deserved credit for his great
services in the earlier part of the war,&mdash;the expedition
to Canada, and besides smaller engagements,
the terrible battle of Valcour Island,
Lake Champlain, in which he was defeated only
by the great superiority of the enemy in numbers
of both men and vessels. Though beaten, he
brought away to Ticonderoga his remaining
vessels and surviving troops. His obstinate
resistance so discouraged the British general,
Carleton, that he retired to Montreal for the
winter, which made it possible for the Northern
army to spare three thousand troops to help
Washington in striking his great blows at
Princeton and Trenton."</p>

<p>"And after all that, as I remember reading,"
said Max, "Congress treated Arnold shamefully,
promoting other officers over his head
who neither stood so high in rank nor had done
half the service he had. I'm sure his anger at
the injustice was very natural; yet he still fought
bravely for his country,&mdash;didn't he, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and all that occurred some months
before this battle of Saratoga, in which he did
such service. Ah, if his career had ended there
and then, what a patriot he would now be considered!
It is almost certain that if he had
been properly reinforced by Gates, he would
have inflicted a crushing defeat upon Burgoyne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>at, or shortly after, the battle of Freeman's
farm. But Gates was very jealous of Arnold,
disliking him as a warm friend of General Schuyler,
and the two had a fierce quarrel between
that battle and the one of Saratoga, occasioned
by Gates, prompted by his jealousy, taking
some of Arnold's best troops from his command.
Arnold then asked and received permission to
return to Philadelphia; but the other officers,
perceiving that another and decisive battle was
about to be fought, persuaded Arnold to remain
and share in it, as they had no confidence in
Gates, who was, without doubt, a coward. He
showed himself such by remaining in his tent
while the battle was going on, though Burgoyne
was, as I have said, in the thick of it. It was a
great victory that crowned our arms on the 7th
of October, 1777, and was due more to Arnold's
efforts than to those of any other man, though
Morgan also did a great deal to win it."</p>

<p>"Wasn't Arnold wounded in this battle,
Papa?" asked Max.</p>

<p>"Yes, severely, in the leg which had been
hurt at Quebec. It was just at the close of the
battle. He was carried on a litter to Albany,
where he remained, disabled, till the next spring.
One must ever detest treason and a traitor; yet
I think it quite possible&mdash;even probable&mdash;that
if Arnold had always received fair and just treatment,
he would never have attempted to betray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>his country as he afterward did. Now we will
go inside, and see what we can find of interest
there."</p>

<p>The Captain led the way as he spoke.</p>

<p>They lingered awhile in the lower room examining
with great interest the tablets and historical
pictures, sculptured in bronze, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">alto rilievo</i>,
which adorned its walls.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, see!" cried Lulu; "here is Mrs.
Schuyler setting fire to a field of wheat to keep
the British from getting it, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes," her father said; "these are Revolutionary
scenes."</p>

<p>"Here is George III.," said Max, "consulting
with his ministers how he shall subdue the
Americans. Ha, ha! they did their best, but
couldn't succeed. My countrymen of that day
would be free."</p>

<p>"As Americans always will, I hope and believe,"
said Lulu. "I feel sure your countrywomen
will anyhow."</p>

<p>At that her father, giving her a smile of mingled
pleasure and amusement, said, "Now we
will go up to the top of the shaft, and take a
bird's-eye view of the surrounding country."</p>

<p>They climbed the winding stairway to its top,
and from thence had a view of not only the battle-field,
but of other historic spots also lying in
all directions.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu were deeply interested, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>had many questions to ask, which their father
answered with unfailing patience.</p>

<p>But, indeed, ardent patriot that he was, he
keenly enjoyed making his children fully acquainted
with the history of their country, and
there was much connected with the surrounding
scenes which it was a pleasure to relate, or remind
them of, as having happened there.</p>

<p>From the scenes of the fight and the surrender
they drove on to the Marshall place, the Captain
giving the order as they reseated themselves in
the carriage.</p>

<p>"The Marshall place, Papa? What about
it?" asked Max and Lulu in a breath.</p>

<p>"It is a house famous for its connection with
the fighting in the neighbourhood of Saratoga,"
replied the Captain. "It was there the Baroness
Riedesel took refuge with her children on the
10th of October, 1777, about two o'clock in the
afternoon, going there with her three little girls,
trying to get as far from the scene of conflict as
she well could."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" said Max. "I remember,
now, that there was a Baron Riedesel in the
British army,&mdash;a Hessian officer, in command
of four thousand men; wasn't he, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and his wife seems to have been a
lovely woman. She nursed poor General Frazer
in his dying agonies. You may remember that he
was killed by one of Morgan's men in the battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>of Bemis Heights, or Saratoga, fought on the
7th,&mdash;or rather, I should say, he was mortally
wounded and carried to the Taylor House, where
the Baroness Riedesel had prepared a dinner for
the officers, which was standing partly served
upon the table. He lay there in great agony
until the next morning, and then died."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Papa, I remember about him!"
said Lulu; "and that he was buried the same
evening in the Great Redoubt, which was a part
of the British intrenchments on the hills near
the river."</p>

<p>"Yes, the strongest part," said Max. "I
remember reading of it, and that the Americans
opened fire on the procession from the other side
of the river, not understanding what it was; so
that while the chaplain was reading the service
at the grave, hostile shots were ploughing up the
ground at his feet, and covering the party with
dust."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, won't you take us to see his
grave?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, if we have time."</p>

<p>"Here we are, sir. This is the Marshall
place," announced the driver, reining in his
horses in front of a modest-looking farm-house;
"and here comes a lad that'll show you
round, and tell you the whole story of what
happened in and about here in the time of the
Revolution."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>The Captain quickly alighted, helped Lulu out,
and Max sprang after them.</p>

<p>The lad had already opened the gate, and
lifted his hat with a bow and smile. "Good-morning!"
he said.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond returned the salutation,
adding, "I would like very much to show my
children those parts of your house here connected
with Revolutionary memories, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; yes!" returned the boy, pleasantly.
"I'll take you in and about; it's quite
the thing for visitors to Saratoga to come over
here on that errand."</p>

<p>He led the way into the house as he spoke,
the Captain, Max, and Lulu following.</p>

<p>They passed through a hall, and on into the
parlour, without meeting any one.</p>

<p>"This," said the lad, "is the northeast room,
where Surgeon Jones was killed by a cannon-ball;
perhaps you may remember about it, sir.
The doctors were at work on him, cutting off a
wounded leg, when a ball came in at that northeast
corner and took off his other leg in its way
diagonally across the room. They gave up trying
to save him, then, and left him to die in yon
corner," pointing to it as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" sighed Lulu. "I can't help
feeling sorry for him, though he was an enemy
to my country."</p>

<p>"No, Miss, it was a pity, and does make one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>feel sorry; for I suppose he really had no choice
but to obey the orders of his king," returned the
lad. "Well, the ball passed on, broke through
the plank partition of the hall, and buried itself
in the ground outside. They say eleven cannon-balls
passed through the house in just a little
while. For my part, I'd rather have been in a
battle than keeping quiet here to be shot at."</p>

<p>"I certainly would," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"I, too," said Max. "I should say there was
very little fun in standing such a fire with no
chance to return it."</p>

<p>"Yes; and our people would never have fired
on them if they had known they were women,
children, and wounded men; but you see they&mdash;the
Americans&mdash;saw people gathering here, and
thought the British were making the place their
headquarters. So they trained their artillery on
it, and opened such a fire as presently sent everybody
to the cellar. Will you walk down and look
at that, sir?" addressing the Captain.</p>

<p>"If it is convenient," he returned, following
with Max and Lulu as their young guide led the
way.</p>

<p>"Quite, sir," he answered; then, as they
entered the cellar, "There have been some
changes in the hundred years and more that
have passed since that terrible time," he said.
"You see there is but one partition wall now;
there were two then, but one has been torn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>down, and the floor cemented. Otherwise the
cellars are just as they were at the time of the
fight; only a good deal cleaner, I suspect," he
added, with a smile, "for packed as they were
with women, children, and wounded officers and
soldiers, there must have been a good deal of
filth about, as well as bad air."</p>

<p>"They certainly are beautifully clean, light,
and sweet now, whatever they may have been
on that October day of 1777," the Captain said,
glancing admiringly at the rows of shining milk-pans
showing a tempting display of thick yellow
cream, and the great fruit-bins standing ready
for the coming harvest.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; to me it seems a rather inviting-looking
place at present," returned the lad,
glancing from side to side with a smile of satisfaction;
"but I've sometimes pictured it to myself
as it must have looked then,&mdash;crowded, you
know, with frightened women and children, and
wounded officers being constantly brought in for
nursing, in agonies of pain, groaning, and perhaps
screaming, begging for water, which could
be got only from the river, a soldier's wife bringing
a small quantity at a time."</p>

<p>"Yes, a woman could do that, of course,"
said Lulu; "for our soldiers would never fire
on a woman,&mdash;certainly not for doing such a
thing as that."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," exclaimed Max, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>scornful tone. "American men fire on a woman
doing such a thing as that? I should say not!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I should hope not!" returned
their young conductor, leading the way from the
cellar to the upper hall, and out into the grounds.
"Yonder," he said, pointing with his finger,
"away to the southwest, Burgoyne's troops were
stationed; the German auxiliaries, too, were
resting from their fight, near Bemis Heights.
Away to the west there, Morgan's famous riflemen
were taking up their position along Burgoyne's
front and flank, while Colonel Fellows
was over yonder," turning to the east and again
pointing with his finger, "bringing his batteries
to bear upon the British. Just as the Baroness
Riedesel in her calash with her three little girls
stopped before the house, some American sharpshooters
across the river levelled their muskets,
and she had barely time to push her children to
the bottom of the wagon and throw herself down
beside them, before the bullets came whistling
overhead. Neither she nor the little folks were
hurt, but a soldier belonging to their party was
badly wounded. The Baroness and her children
spent the night there in the cellar. So did other
ladies from the British army who followed her to
this retreat that afternoon. They were in one
of its three divisions, the wounded officers in
another, and the common soldiers occupied the
third."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>"It must have been a dreadful night to the
poor Baroness and those little girls," remarked
Lulu, who was listening with keenest interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," responded the lad; "the cries
and groans of the wounded, the darkness, dampness,
and filth and stench of the wounds, all
taken together, must have made an awful night
for them all. I wonder, for my part, that the
women and children weren't left at home in
their own countries."</p>

<p>"That's where they ought to have been, I
think," said Lulu. "Was it that night Surgeon
Jones was killed?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss, the next day, when the Americans
began firing again harder than ever."</p>

<p>"Where were they firing from then?" Lulu
asked.</p>

<p>"The other side of the river, Miss; probably
from some rising ground a little north of Batten
Kil."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what more have you to show us?"
asked the Captain, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"A plank cut and shattered at one end, probably
by the ball that killed the Surgeon. This
way, if you please; here it is. And here is a
rafter which you see has been partly cut in two
by a shell. It was taken out of the frame of the
house while they were repairing in 1868. Here
are some other bits of shot and shell that have
been ploughed up on the farm at different times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Ah! there are some things at the house I should
have shown you."</p>

<p>"We will not mind going back so short a distance,"
said the Captain, "and would be glad to
see everything you have to show us."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and I think you will say these
things are worth looking at."</p>

<p>He led them back into the house and exhibited,
first, a gold coin with the figure and
inscription of George III. on one side, the British
arms and an inscription with the date 1776
on the other, then a curious old musket, with
bayonet and flint lock, which was carried in the
Revolutionary War by an ancestor of the family
now residing there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>"You may take us now to Frazer's grave,"
Captain Raymond said to the driver as they
re-entered their carriage after a cordial good-by
and liberal gift to their young guide.</p>

<p>"Please tell us something more about Frazer,
Papa, won't you?" requested Lulu.</p>

<p>"Willingly," returned her father. "Frazer
was a brave and skilful officer; made brigadier-general
for America only, by Carleton, in June,
1776. He helped to drive the Americans out of
Canada in that year. Burgoyne chose him to
command the light brigade which formed the
right wing of the British army, so that he was
constantly in the advance. In the fight of October
7th he made a conspicuous figure, dressed in
the full uniform of a field-officer, mounted on a
splendid iron-gray gelding, and exerting himself
to encourage and cheer on his men. Morgan
saw how important he was to the British cause,
pointed him out to his sharpshooters, and bade
them cut him off. 'That gallant officer,' he said,
'is General Frazer. I admire and honour him;
but it is necessary he should die, because victory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>for the enemy depends upon him. Take your stations
in that clump of bushes, and do your duty!'
They obeyed, and in five minutes Frazer fell
mortally wounded, and was carried from the field
by two grenadiers. Only a few moments before
he was hit, the crupper of his horse was cut by a
rifle-ball, and directly afterward another passed
through the horse's mane, a little back of his
ears. Then his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aide</i> said, 'General, it is evident
that you are marked out for particular aim;
would it not be prudent for you to retire from
this place?' 'My duty forbids me to retire from
danger,' Frazer answered; and the next moment
he fell. That is Lossing's account; and he goes
on to say that Morgan has been censured for the
order by some persons, professing to understand
the rules of war, as guilty of a highly dishonourable
act; also by others, who gloat over the horrid
details of the slaying of thousands of humble
rank-and-file men as deeds worthy of a shout for
glory, and have no tears to shed for the slaughtered
ones, but affect to shudder at such a cold-blooded
murder of an officer on the battle-field.
But, as Lossing justly remarks, the life of an
officer is no dearer to himself, his wife, and children,
than that of a private to his, and that
the slaying of Frazer probably saved the lives
of hundreds of common soldiers."</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa," returned Max, thoughtfully;
"and so I think Morgan deserves all praise for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>giving that order to his men. If Frazer did not
want to lose his life, he should not have come
here to help crush out liberty in this country."</p>

<p>"Papa, do you think he hated the Americans?"
asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"No, I presume not; his principal motive in
coming here and taking an active part in the
war was probably to make a name for himself
as a brave and skilful officer,&mdash;at least, so I
judge from his dying exclamation, 'Oh, fatal
ambition!'"</p>

<p>"How different he was from our Washington,"
exclaimed Max. "He seemed to want nothing
for himself, and sought only his country's good.
Papa, it does seem to me that Washington was
the greatest mere man history tells of."</p>

<p>"I think so," responded the Captain; "he
seems to have been so entirely free from selfishness,
ambition, and pride. And yet he had
enemies and detractors, even among those who
wished well to the cause for which he was doing
so much."</p>

<p>"Such a burning shame!" cried Lulu, her eyes
flashing. "Was Gates one of them, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; to his shame, be it said, he was. He
treated Washington with much disrespect, giving
him no report whatever of the victory at Saratoga.
It was not until early in November that
he wrote at all to the commander-in-chief, and
then merely mentioned the matter incidentally.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>In that month Gates was made president of the
new Board of War and Ordnance, and during
the following winter he joined with what is
known as the 'Conway cabal' in an effort to
supplant Washington in the chief command of
the army."</p>

<p>"What a wretch!" exclaimed Lulu. "It
would have been a very bad thing for our cause
if he had succeeded,&mdash;wouldn't it, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt," answered the Captain;
"for though Gates had some very good qualities,
he was far from being fit to fill the position
held by Washington."</p>

<p>"He wasn't a good Christian man, like Washington,
was he, Papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, not by any means at that time, though
it is said&mdash;I hope with truth&mdash;that he afterward
became one. He was arrogant, untruthful, and
had an overweening confidence in his own ability.
Yet he had some noble traits; he emancipated
his slaves, and provided for those who were unable
to take care of themselves. Also, he was,
it is said, a good and affectionate husband and
father."</p>

<p>"Papa, wasn't it known whose shot killed
Frazer?" queried Max.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was that of a rifleman named Timothy
Murphy. He was posted in a small tree,
took deliberate aim, and saw Frazer fall. Frazer,
too, told some one he saw the man who shot him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>and that he was in a tree. Murphy was one of
Morgan's surest shots."</p>

<p>"I should think he must always have felt
badly about it, only that he knew he did it to
help save his country," said Lulu.</p>

<p>"It seemed to be necessary for the salvation
of our country," replied her father; "and no
doubt that thought prevented Murphy's conscience
from troubling him."</p>

<p>"Didn't the Americans at first fire on the
funeral procession, Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes; but ceased as soon as they understood
the nature of the gathering, and at regular intervals
the solemn boom of a single cannon was
heard along the valley. It was a minute-gun,
fired by the Americans in honour of their fallen
foe, the gallant dead. Ah, here we are at his
grave!" added the Captain, as horses and
vehicle came to a standstill and the carriage-door
was thrown open.</p>

<p>They alighted and walked about the grave and
its monument, pausing to read the inscription on
the latter.</p>

<p>"Though an enemy to our country, he was a
gallant man, a brave and good soldier," remarked
the Captain, reflectively.</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa; and I can't help feeling sorry
for him," said Lulu. "I suppose he had to obey
his king's orders of course; he couldn't well
help it, and probably he had no real hatred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>the people of this country. It does seem hard
that he had to die and be buried so far away
from all he loved."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Max; "but he had to be killed
to save our country, since he would use his time
and talents in trying to help reduce her to slavery.
I'm sorry for him, too; but as he would put his
talents to so wrong a use, there was no choice
but to kill him,&mdash;isn't that so, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied the Captain; "but it
was a great pity. Frazer was a brave officer,
idolized by his own men, and respected by even
his enemies."</p>

<p>"It seems sad he should lie buried so far
away from all he loved,&mdash;all his own people;
and in a strange land, too. But he could hardly
lie in a lovelier spot, I think," remarked Lulu;
"the hills, the mountains, the beautiful river,
the woods, the fields, and these tall twin pine-trees
standing like sentinels beside his grave,&mdash;oh
I think it is just lovely! I think he showed
excellent taste in his choice of a burial-place."</p>

<p>"Yes, nice place enough to lie in, if one could
only be on top of the ground and able to see
what it's like," came in hollow tones, seemingly
from the grave.</p>

<p>The Captain glanced at his son with a slightly
amused smile.</p>

<p>Lulu was startled for an instant; then, with a
little laugh, as her father took her hand and led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>her back to the waiting carriage, "Oh, Maxie,
that was almost too bad, though he was an enemy
to our country!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have done it if I'd thought it
would hurt his feelings," returned Max, in a tone
of mock regret; "but I really didn't suppose
he'd know or care anything about it."</p>

<p>"Where now, sir?" asked the driver as the
Captain handed Lulu to her seat.</p>

<p>"To the Schuyler mansion," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad we're going there!" exclaimed
Lulu. "I've always liked everything I've heard
about General Schuyler; and I'll be ever so glad
to see the house he used to live in."</p>

<p>"It isn't the same house that Burgoyne caroused
in the night after the battle of Bemis
Heights, is it, Papa?" asked Max.</p>

<p>"No; that was burned by Burgoyne's orders
a few days later," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"And when was this one built?" asked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"That is a disputed point," said her father.
"Some say it was shortly after the surrender in
1777; others, not until soon after the peace of
1783."</p>

<p>"Anyhow it was General Schuyler's house,
and so we'll be glad to see it," she said. "Papa,
is it on the exact spot where the other&mdash;the first
one&mdash;was? The one Burgoyne caroused in, I
mean."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>"They say not, quite; that it stands a little
to the west of where the first one did."</p>

<p>"But General Schuyler owned and lived in it,
which makes it almost, if not quite, as well worth
seeing as the first one would have been," said
Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the Captain. "It was on his
return from Bemis Heights that Burgoyne took
possession of the mansion for his headquarters;
that was on the evening of the 9th of October.
His troops, who had been marching through mud,
water, and rain for the last twenty-four hours,
with nothing to eat, encamped unfed on the wet
ground near Schuylerville, while he and his cronies
feasted and enjoyed themselves as though
the sufferings of the common soldiery were nothing
to them."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that the night before the day the
Baroness Riedesel went to the Marshall place?"
queried Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied his father. "Her husband,
General Riedesel, and others, urgently remonstrated
against the unnecessary and imprudent
delay, and counselled hasty retreat; but Burgoyne
would not listen to their prudent advice.
While the storm beat upon his hungry, weary
soldiers lying without on the rain-soaked ground,
he and his mates held high carnival within,
spending the night in merry-making, drinking,
and carousing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>"What a foolish fellow!" said Max. "I
wonder that he didn't rather spend it in slipping
away from the Americans through the
darkness and storm."</p>

<p>"Or in getting ready to fight them again the
next day," added Lulu.</p>

<p>"I think there was fighting the next day,&mdash;wasn't
there, Papa?" said Max.</p>

<p>"Yes; though not a regular battle. Burgoyne
was attempting a retreat, which the Americans,
constantly increasing in numbers, were preventing,&mdash;destroying
bridges, obstructing roads
leading northward, and guarding the river to
the eastward, so that the British troops
could not cross it without exposure to a murderous
artillery fire. At last, finding his provisions
nearly exhausted, himself surrounded
by more than five times his own number of
troops, and all his positions commanded by his
enemy's artillery, the proud British general
surrendered."</p>

<p>"And it was a great victory,&mdash;wasn't it,
Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"It was, indeed! and God, the God of our
fathers, gave it to the American people. The time
was one of the great crises of history. Before
that battle things looked very dark for the people
of this land; and if Burgoyne had been victorious,
the probability is that the struggle for liberty
would have been given up for no one knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>how long. Perhaps we might have been still
subject to England."</p>

<p>"And that would be dreadful!" she exclaimed
with warmth,&mdash;"wouldn't it, Max?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" he assented, his cheek flushing,
and his eye kindling; "the idea of this
great country being governed by that bit of
an island away across the sea! I just feel
sometimes as if I'd like to have helped with
the fight."</p>

<p>"In that case," returned his father, with an
amused look, "you would hardly be here now;
or, if you were, you would be old enough to be
my grandfather."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad I wasn't, sir," laughed Max;
"for I'd rather be your son by a great deal.
Papa, wasn't it about that time the stars and
stripes were first used?"</p>

<p>"No, my son; there was at least one used
before that," the Captain said with a half smile,&mdash;"at
Fort Schuyler, which was attacked by St.
Leger with his band of British troops, Canadians,
Indians, and Tories, early in the previous
August. The garrison was without a flag when
the enemy appeared before it, but soon supplied
themselves by their own ingenuity, tearing shirts
into strips to make the white stripes and stars,
joining bits of scarlet cloth for the red stripes,
and using a blue cloth cloak, belonging to one
of the officers, as the groundwork for the stars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Before sunset it was waving in the breeze over
one of the bastions of the fort, and no doubt
its makers gazed upon it with pride and
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nice!" exclaimed Lulu. "But
I don't remember about the fighting at that fort.
Did St. Leger take it, Papa?"</p>

<p>"No; the gallant garrison held out against
him till Arnold came to their relief. The story
is a very interesting one; but I must reserve it
for another time, as we are now nearing Schuyler's
mansion."</p>

<p>The mansion was already in sight, and in a
few moments their carriage had drawn up in
front of it. They were politely received, and
shown a number of interesting relics.</p>

<p>The first thing that attracted their attention
was an artistic arrangement of arms on the wall
fronting the great front door.</p>

<p>"Oh, what are those?" Lulu asked in eager
tones, her eyes fixed upon them in an intensely
interested way. "Please, sir, may I go and
look at them?" addressing the gentleman who
had received them and now invited them to
walk in.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," he answered with a smile,
and leading the way. "This," he said, touching
the hilt of a sword, "was carried at the
battle of Bennington by an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aide</i> of General
Stark. This other sword, and this musket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>and cartridge-box, belonged to John Strover,
and were carried by him in the battles of the
Revolution."</p>

<p>"Valuable and interesting souvenirs," remarked
Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>They were shown other relics of those troublous
times,&mdash;shells, grape, knee and shoe
buckles, grubbing-hooks, and other things that
had been picked up on the place in the years
that had elapsed since the struggle for independence.
But what interested Max and Lulu
still more than any of these was a beautiful
teacup, from which, as the gentleman told
them, General Washington, while on a visit
to General Schuyler, had drunk tea made from
a portion of one of those cargoes of Boston
harbour fame.</p>

<p>"That cup must be very precious, sir," remarked
Lulu, gazing admiringly at it. "If
it were mine, money couldn't buy it from
me."</p>

<p>"No," he returned pleasantly; "and I am
sure you would never have robbed us, as some
vandal visitor did not long ago, of a saucer
and plate belonging to the same set."</p>

<p>"No, no, indeed!" she replied with emphasis,
and looking quite aghast at the very
idea. "Could anybody be so wicked as
that?"</p>

<p>"Somebody was," he said with a slight sigh;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>"and it has made us feel it necessary to be more
careful to whom we show such things. Now let
me show you the burial-place of Thomas Lovelace,"
he added, leading the way out into the
grounds.</p>

<p>"I don't remember to have heard his story,
sir," said Max, as they all followed in the gentleman's
wake; "but I would like to very much
indeed. Papa, I suppose you know all about
him."</p>

<p>"I presume this gentleman can tell the story
far better than I," replied the Captain, with an
inquiring look at their guide.</p>

<p>"I will do my best," he said in reply. "You
know, doubtless," with a glance at Max and his
sister, "what the Tories of the Revolution were.
Some of them were the bitterest foes of their
countrymen who were in that fearful struggle
for freedom,&mdash;wicked men, who cared really for
nothing but enriching themselves at the expense
of others, and from covetousness became as
relentless robbers and murderers of their neighbours
and former friends as the very savages of
the wilderness. Lovelace was one of these, and
had become a terror to the inhabitants of this his
native district of Saratoga. He went to Canada
about the beginning of the war, and there confederated
with five other men like himself to
come back to this region and plunder, betray,
and abduct those who were struggling for freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>from their British oppressors,&mdash;old neighbours,
for whom he should have felt only pity and
kindness, even if he did not see things in just
the same light that they did. These miscreants
had their place of rendezvous in a large swamp,
about five miles from Colonel Van Vetchen's, cunningly
concealing themselves there. Robberies
in that neighbourhood became frequent, and several
persons were carried off. General Stark,
then in command of the barracks north of Fish
Creek, was active and vigilant; and hearing
that Lovelace and his men had robbed General
Schuyler's house, and were planning to carry off
Colonel Van Vetchen, frustrated their design by
furnishing the Colonel with a guard. Then
Captain Dunham, who commanded a company
of militia in the neighbourhood, hearing of the
plans and doings of the marauders, at once summoned
his lieutenant, ensign, orderly, and one
private to his house. They laid their plans,
waited till dark, then set out for the big swamp,
which was three miles distant. There they separated
to reconnoitre, and two of them were lost;
but the other three kept together, and at dawn
came upon the hiding-place of the Tory robbers.
They were up, and just drawing on their stockings.
The three Americans crawled cautiously
toward them till quite near, then sprang upon a
log with a shout, levelled their muskets, and
Dunham called out, 'Surrender, or you are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>dead men!' The robbers, thinking the Americans
were upon them in force, surrendered at
once, coming out one at a time without their
arms, and were marched off to General Stark's
camp, and given up to him as prisoners. They
were tried by a court-martial as spies, traitors,
and robbers; and Lovelace, who was considered
too dangerous to be allowed to escape, was
condemned to be hanged. He complained that
his sentence was unjust, and that he should
be treated as a prisoner of war; but his claim
was disallowed, and he was hanged here amid
a violent storm of wind, rain, thunder, and
lightning."</p>

<p>"They hung him as a spy, did they, sir?"
asked Max.</p>

<p>"As a spy and murderer. He was both;
and," pointing out the precise spot, "after his
execution he was buried here in a standing
posture."</p>

<p>"And his bones are lying right under here
are they, sir?" asked Lulu, shuddering as she
glanced down at the spot the gentleman had
indicated.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply; "his bones, and even
his teeth, have been carried off as relics."</p>

<p>"Ugh! to want such things as those for
relics!" Lulu exclaimed in a tone of emphatic
disgust.</p>

<p>"They are certainly not such relics as I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>care to have," returned the gentleman, with a
smile. Then he told the Captain he had shown
them everything he had which could be called a
souvenir of the Revolutionary War, and with
hearty thanks they took their leave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>It was dinner-time when Captain Raymond
and his children reached their hotel, and at the
conclusion of the meal they went immediately to
the station of the Mount McGregor road. There
was just time for the buying of the tickets and
seating themselves comfortably in the cars before
the train started.</p>

<p>"Papa, how long will it take us to go there?"
asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five minutes," he answered. "It is
about ten miles to the mountain; then we go
up about eleven hundred feet above Saratoga
Springs."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Max; "and here on this
time-table it says that in some places the grade
is as high as two hundred and forty-six feet to
the mile."</p>

<p>"Set that down in your memory," returned
his father, with a smile. "Now look out of the
windows, Max and Lulu; the country is well
worth seeing."</p>

<p>The ride seemed very short,&mdash;it was so enjoyable,&mdash;and
Lulu was quite surprised when the
car stopped and all the passengers hurried out.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>Every one went into the Drexel Cottage, which
was close at hand. A man showed them about,
pointing out the objects of special interest,&mdash;the
bed where General Grant died, the candle he had
extinguished but a few minutes before breathing
his last, and so on.</p>

<p>They spent some time in the cottage, going
quietly about, looking with a sad interest at
everything which had any connection with the
dear departed great man, then went on up to
the mountain top, where stood a large hotel.
They passed it, and went on to the edge of the
mountain, which overlooks the Hudson River
valley.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely view!" cried Lulu, in delight.
"What mountains are those, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Those to the east," he replied, pointing in
that direction as he spoke, "are the Green
Mountains, those to the north are the Adirondacks,
and those to the south the Catskills."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lu, look yonder!" cried Max. "There's
Schuylerville with its monument, I do believe,&mdash;isn't
it, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right,&mdash;the place of Burgoyne's
surrender, which we visited this morning," the
Captain answered. "Now suppose we go to the
observatory at the top of the hotel, and take
the view from there."</p>

<p>Max and Lulu gave an eager assent to the
proposal. There were a good many stairs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>climb, but the view fully repaid them for the
exertion. They spent some minutes in gazing
upon it, then descended and wandered through
the woods till the train was ready to start down
the mountain.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu were tired enough to go to bed
at dark; and the next morning they took an
early train to Albany, where they boarded a fine
steamer, which would carry them down the Hudson
River to West Point, where, to the children's
great delight, their father had promised to stay
a day or two, and show them all of historical
interest connected with the spot.</p>

<p>It was the first trip on the Hudson that Max
or his sister had ever taken, and they enjoyed it
greatly,&mdash;all the more because their father was
sufficiently familiar with the scenes through
which they were passing to call their attention
to whatever was best worth noticing, and give
all desired information in regard to it, doing so
in the kindest and pleasantest manner possible.
The weather was all that could be desired,&mdash;cloudy,
with an occasional shower, seldom heavy
enough to obscure the view to any great extent,
and just cooling the air pleasantly, as Lulu remarked
with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was not raining when they landed at West
Point, though clouds still veiled the sun. They
took a carriage near the wharf, and drove to the
hotel. As they alighted, some gentlemen were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>talking upon its porch, one of whom was in military
uniform.</p>

<p>"Raymond, this is a meeting as delightful
as unexpected,&mdash;to me at least!" he
exclaimed, coming hastily forward with out-stretched
hand.</p>

<p>"Keith, I don't know when I have had a
pleasanter surprise!" returned Captain Raymond,
taking the offered hand and shaking it
heartily, while his eyes shone with pleasure.
"You are not here permanently?"</p>

<p>"No; only on a furlough. And you?"</p>

<p>"Just for a day or two, to show my children
our military academy and the points
of historical interest in its vicinity," replied
Captain Raymond, glancing down upon them
with a smile of fatherly pride and affection.
"Max and Lulu, this gentleman is Lieutenant
Keith, of whom you have sometimes heard me
speak, and whom your mamma calls Cousin
Donald."</p>

<p>"Your children, are they? Ah, I think I
might have known them anywhere from their
remarkable resemblance to you, Raymond!" Mr.
Keith said, shaking hands first with Lulu, then
with Max.</p>

<p>He chatted pleasantly with them for a few
minutes, while their father attended to engaging
rooms and having the baggage taken up to
them. When he rejoined them Keith asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"May I have the pleasure of showing you about,
Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; no better escort could be desired,"
replied the Captain, heartily, "you being
a valued friend just met after a long separation,
and also an old resident here, thoroughly competent
for the task, and thoroughly acquainted
with all the points of interest."</p>

<p>"I think I may say I am that," returned
Keith, with a smile; "and it will give me the
greatest pleasure to show them to you,&mdash;as
great, doubtless, as you seemed to find some
years ago in showing me over your man-of-war.
But first, let us take a view from the porch here.
Yonder," pointing in a westerly direction, "at
the foot of the hills, are the dwellings of the officers
and professors. In front of them you see
the parade-ground: there, on the south side, are
the barracks. There is the Grecian chapel,
yonder the library building, with its domed
turrets, and there are the mess hall and hospital."
Then turning toward the west again,
"That lofty summit," he said, "is Mount
Independence, and the ruins that crown it are
those of 'Old Fort Put.' That still loftier
peak is Redoubt Hill. There, a little to the
north, you see Old Cro' Nest and Butter
Hill. Now, directly north, through that magnificent
cleft in the hills, you can see Newburgh
and its bay. Of the scenery in the east we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>will have a better view from the ruins of
'Old Put.'"</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the Captain. "Shall we go
up there at once?"</p>

<p>"If you like, Raymond. I always enjoy the
view; it more than pays for the climb. But,"
and Mr. Keith glanced somewhat doubtfully at
Lulu, "shall we not take a carriage? I fear the
walk may be too much for your little girl."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Lulu?" her father asked
with a smiling glance at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd rather walk, Papa!" she exclaimed.
"We have been riding so much for the last week
and more; and you know I'm strong and well,
and dearly love to climb rocks and hills."</p>

<p>"Very well, you shall do as you like, and
have the help of Papa's hand over the hard
places," he said, offering it as he spoke.</p>

<p>She put hers into it with a glad look and smile
up into his face that almost made Donald Keith
envy the Captain the joys of fatherhood.</p>

<p>They set off at once. Lulu found it a rather
hard climb, or that it would have been without
her father's helping hand; but the top of Mount
Independence was at length reached, and the little
party stood among the ruins of Fort Putnam.
They stood on its ramparts recovering breath
after the ascent, their faces turned toward the
east, silently gazing upon the beautiful panorama
spread out at their feet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the Captain who broke the silence.
"You see that range of hills on the farther side
of the river, children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," both replied with an inquiring look
up into his face.</p>

<p>"In the time of the Revolution every pinnacle
was fortified, and on each a watch-fire burned,"
he said.</p>

<p>"They had a battery on each, Papa?" queried
Max.</p>

<p>"Yes; but yonder, at their foot, stands something
that will interest you still more,&mdash;the
Beverly House, from which Arnold the traitor
fled to the British ship 'Vulture,' on learning
that André had been taken."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it, sir?" exclaimed Max, in a tone of
intense interest. "How I would like to visit it,&mdash;can
we, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I too; oh, very much!" said Lulu. "Please
take us there,&mdash;won't you, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I fear there will be hardly time, my dears;
but I will see about it," was the indulgent reply.</p>

<p>"You have been here before, Raymond?" Mr.
Keith said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; on my first bridal trip," the Captain
answered in a low, moved tone, and sighing
slightly as the words left his lips.</p>

<p>"With our own mother, Papa?" asked Lulu,
softly, looking up into his face with eyes full of
love and sympathy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, daughter; and she enjoyed the view
very much as you are doing now."</p>

<p>"I'm glad; I like to think she saw it once."</p>

<p>An affectionate pressure of the hand he held
was his only reply. Then turning to his friend,
"It is a grand view, Keith," he said; "and one
that always stirs the patriotism in my blood, inherited
from ancestors who battled for freedom
in those Revolutionary days."</p>

<p>"It is just so with myself," replied Keith;
"and the view is a grand one in itself, though
there were no such association,&mdash;a superb panorama!
The beautiful, majestic river sweeping
about the rock-bound promontory below us there,
with its tented field; yonder the distant spires
of Newburgh, and the bright waters of its bay,
seen through that magnificent cleft in the hills,"
pointing with his finger as he spoke,&mdash;"ah, how
often I have seen it all in imagination when out
in the far West scouting over arid plains, and
among desolate barren hills and mountains,
where savages and wild beasts abound! At
times an irrepressible longing for this very view
has come over me,&mdash;a sort of homesickness,
most difficult to shake off."</p>

<p>"Such as years in the ports of foreign lands
have sometimes brought upon me," observed the
Captain, giving his friend a look of heartfelt
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Dear Papa, I'm so glad that is all over,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Lulu said softly, leaning lovingly up against him
as she spoke, and again lifting to his eyes her
own so full of sympathy and affection. "Oh,
it is so pleasant to have you always at home
with us!"</p>

<p>A smile and an affectionate pressure of the little
soft white hand he held were his only reply.</p>

<p>"Ah, my little girl, when Papa sees a man-of-war
again, he will be likely to wish himself back
in the service once more!" remarked Keith, in a
sportive tone, regarding her with laughing eyes.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't believe it," she returned
stoutly. "Papa loves his home and wife and
children too well for that; besides, he has resigned
from the navy, and I don't believe they'd
take him back again."</p>

<p>"Well, Lu," said Max, "that's a pretty way
to talk about Papa! Now, it's my firm conviction
that they'd be only too glad to get him
back."</p>

<p>"That's right, Max; stand up for your father
always," laughed Keith. "He is worthy of it;
and I don't doubt the government would be
ready to accept his services should he offer
them."</p>

<p>"Of course," laughed the Captain; "but I intend
to give them those of my son instead,"
turning a look upon Max so proudly tender and
appreciative that the lad's young heart bounded
with joy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, is that so?" said Keith, gazing appreciatively
into the lad's bright young face. "Well,
I have no doubt he will do you credit. Max, my
boy, never forget that you have the credit of an
honourable name to sustain, and that in so doing
you will make your father a proud and happy
man."</p>

<p>"That is what I want to do, sir," replied Max,
modestly. Then hastily changing the subject,
"Papa, is that town over there Phillipstown?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what do you remember about it?"</p>

<p>"That a part of our Revolutionary army was
camped there in 1781. And there, over to the
left, is Constitution Island,&mdash;isn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his father; then went on to
tell of the building of the fort from which the
island takes its name, and its abandonment a
few days after the capture by the British of
Forts Clinton and Montgomery, near the lower
entrance to the Highlands, in 1777.</p>

<p>"Such a pity, after they had been to all the
expense and trouble of building it!" remarked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a waste," said Max; "but
war's a wasteful business anyway it can be
managed."</p>

<p>"Quite true, Max," said, Mr. Keith; "and
soldier though I am, I sincerely hope we may
have no more of it in this land."</p>

<p>"No, sir; but the best way to keep out of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>is to show ourselves ready for self-defence. That
is what Papa says."</p>

<p>"And I entirely agree with him. Shall we go
now, Raymond, and see what of interest is to be
found in the buildings and about the grounds of
the academy?"</p>

<p>The Captain gave a ready assent, and they
retraced their steps, he helping Lulu down the
mountain as he had helped her up.</p>

<p>Keith took them, first, to the artillery laboratory
to see, as he said, some trophies and relics
of the Revolution. Conducting them to the centre
of the court, "Here," he remarked, "are some
interesting ones," pointing, as he spoke, to several
cannon lying in a heap, and encircled by some
links of an enormous chain.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Max, "is that part of the
great chain that was stretched across the Hudson,
down there by Constitution Island, in the
time of the Revolution?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Keith. "And these two brass
mortars were taken from Burgoyne at Saratoga;
this larger one, Wayne took from the British at
Stony Point. I dare say you and your sister are
acquainted with the story of that famous exploit."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" they both replied; and Lulu
asked, "Is that the English coat-of-arms on the
big cannon?"</p>

<p>Her look directed the query to her father, and
he answered, "Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>"And what do these words below it mean,
Papa,&mdash;'Aschaleh fecit, 1741'?"</p>

<p>"Aschaleh is doubtless the name of the maker;
'<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fecit</i>' means he executed it, and 1741 gives the
time when it was done."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," she said. "Is there any
story about that one?" pointing to another cannon
quite near at hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "by its premature discharge,
in 1817, a cadet named Lowe was killed. In
the cemetery is a beautiful monument to his
memory."</p>

<p>"Here are two brass field-pieces, each marked
'G. R.,'" said Max. "Do those letters stand
for George Rex,&mdash;King George,&mdash;Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that was the monogram of the
king."</p>

<p>"And the cannon is fourteen years younger
than those others," remarked Lulu; "for, see
there, it says, 'W. Bowen fecit, 1755.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, here's an inscription!" exclaimed Max,
and read aloud, "'Taken from the British
army, and presented, by order of the United
States, in Congress assembled, to Major-General
Green, as a monument of their high sense of the
wisdom, fortitude, and military talents which
distinguished his command in the Southern department,
and of the eminent services which,
amid complicated dangers and difficulties, he
performed for his country. October 18th, 1783.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Oh, that was right!" supplemented the lad, "for
I do think Green was a splendid fellow."</p>

<p>"He was, indeed!" said the Captain; "and
he has at last been given such a monument as he
should have had very many years sooner."</p>

<p>"Where is it, Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"In Washington. It is an equestrian statue,
by Henry Kirke Brown."</p>

<p>"Yes; and very glad I am that even that
tardy act of justice has been done him,&mdash;one of
the bravest and most skilful commanders of our
Revolutionary War," remarked Mr. Keith. Then
he added, "I think we have seen about all you
will care for here, Raymond, and that you might
enjoy going out upon the parade-ground now.
The sun is near setting, and the battalion will
form presently, and go through some interesting
exercises."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" the Captain said. "Let us,
then, go at once, for I see Max and his sister
are eager for the treat," he added, with a smiling
glance from one brightly expectant young face
to the other.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>They reached the parade-ground just in time
to see the battalion forming under arms, and
Max and Lulu watched every movement with
intense interest and delight,&mdash;the long skirmish
lines firing in advance or retreat, picking off distant
imaginary leaders of a pretended enemy in
reply to the ringing skirmish calls of the key-bugles,
deploying at the run, rallying at the
reserves and around the colours.</p>

<p>That last seemed to delight Lulu more than
anything else. "Oh," she exclaimed, "isn't it
lovely! Wouldn't they all fight for the dear old
flag if an enemy should come and try to tear it
down!"</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to think they would," returned
Mr. Keith, smiling at her enthusiasm. "Now
look at the flag waving from the top of the staff
yonder."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when there
came the sudden bang of the sunset gun, and the
flag quickly fluttered to the earth.</p>

<p>Then followed the march of the cadets to their
supper, and our little party turned about and
went in search of theirs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>On leaving the table they went out upon the
hotel porch and seated themselves where the
view was particularly fine, the gentlemen conversing,
Max and Lulu listening, both tired
enough to be quite willing to sit still.</p>

<p>The talk, which was principally of ordnance
and various matters connected with army and
navy, had greater interest for the boy than for
his sister, and Lulu soon laid her head on her
father's shoulder, and was presently in the land
of dreams.</p>

<p>"My poor, tired, little girl!" he said, low and
tenderly, softly smoothing the hair from her forehead
as he spoke.</p>

<p>At that she roused, and lifting her head, said
coaxingly, "Please don't send me to bed yet,
Papa! I'm wide awake now."</p>

<p>"Are you, indeed?" he laughed. "I think
those eyes look rather heavy; but you may sit
up now if you will agree to sleep in the morning
when Max and I will probably be going out to
see the cadets begin their day. Would you like
to go, Max?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir!" answered Max, in eager
tones; "it's about five o'clock we have to start,&mdash;isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Max. Lieutenant Keith has kindly
offered to call us in season, and become our
escort to the camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, mayn't I go too?" pleaded Lulu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>in the most coaxing tones. "I won't give you
the least bit of trouble."</p>

<p>"You never do, daughter, in regard to such
matters; you are always prompt, and ready in
good season."</p>

<p>"Then do you say I may go, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will go to bed at once, in order
to secure enough sleep by five o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir! Yes, indeed, I will,"
she said, hastily rising to her feet, and bidding
good-night to Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"I too," said Max, following her example.</p>

<p>"Good children," said their father; then noticing
the longing look in Lulu's eyes, he excused
himself to his friend, saying he would join him
again presently, and went with them.</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful, bright, engaging, little
girl of yours, Raymond,&mdash;one that any father
might be proud of," remarked Keith when the
Captain had resumed the seat by his side.</p>

<p>"She seems all that to me; but I have sometimes
thought it might be the blindness of parental
affection that makes the child so lovely
and engaging in her father's eyes," returned the
Captain, in tones that spoke much gratification.</p>

<p>"I think, indeed I am sure, not," returned
Keith. "About how old is she?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen. Actually, she'll be a woman before
I know it!" was the added exclamation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>a tone of dismay. "I don't like the thought of
losing my little girl even in that way."</p>

<p>"Ah, you'll be likely to lose her in another
before many years!" laughed his friend. "She'll
make a lovely woman, Raymond!"</p>

<p>"I think you are right," answered the father;
"and I confess that the thought of another gaining
the first place in her heart&mdash;which I know is
mine now&mdash;is far from pleasant to me. Well,
it cannot be for some years yet, and I shall try
not to think of it. Perhaps she may never care
to leave her father."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she will if she is wise. You
are a fortunate man, Raymond! Your son&mdash;the
image of his father&mdash;is not less attractive than
his sister, and evidently a remarkably intelligent
lad. He will make his mark in the navy; and I
dare say we shall have the pleasure of seeing him
an admiral by the time we&mdash;you and I&mdash;are
gray-headed, old veterans."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," returned the Captain, with a
pleased smile; "but promotion is slow in the
navy in these days of peace."</p>

<p>"Quite true; and as true of the army as of
the navy. But even that is to be preferred to
war,&mdash;eh, Raymond?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly," was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"You leave for home to-morrow evening, I
think you said?" was Keith's next remark, made
in an inquiring tone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>"That is my plan at present," replied the
Captain, "though I would stay a little longer
rather than have the children disappointed in
their hope of seeing everything about here that
has any connection with the Revolution."</p>

<p>"They seem to be ardent young patriots,"
said Keith. "It does one good to see their
pride and delight in the flag. How their eyes
shone at the sight of the rally round the colours."</p>

<p>"Yes; and they feel an intense interest in
everything that has any connection with the
Revolutionary struggle. They get it in the
blood; and it has been their father's earnest
endeavour to cultivate in them an ardent love of
country."</p>

<p>"In which he has evidently been remarkably
successful," returned Keith. "I am much mistaken
if that boy does not do you great credit
while in the Naval Academy, and, as I remarked
a moment since, after fairly entering
the service."</p>

<p>"A kind and pleasant prediction, Keith," the
Captain said, giving his friend a gratified look.</p>

<p>"How many children have you, Raymond?"
was the next question.</p>

<p>"Only five," the Captain said, with a happy
laugh,&mdash;"five treasures that should, it seems
to me, make any man feel rich; also, a sweet,
beautiful, young wife, who is to her husband
worth far more than her weight in gold. 'Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>price is above rubies.' And you, Keith,&mdash;you
have not told me whether you have yet found
your mate."</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I sometimes think I never shall,
but shall soon become a confirmed old bachelor,"
Keith replied. Then, after an instant's pause,
"I wonder if Lulu's father would give her to me
should I wait patiently till she is old enough to
know her own mind in such matters, and then
succeed in winning her heart?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Keith, is that a serious thought or a
mere idle jest?" queried the Captain, turning a
surprised and not altogether pleased look upon
his friend.</p>

<p>"A sort of mixture of the two, I believe, Raymond,"
was the laughing reply; "but I haven't
the least idea of putting any such mischief into
your daughter's head,&mdash;at least, not at present.
But if I ask your permission half a dozen years
hence to pay my court to her, I hope it will not
be refused."</p>

<p>"Well, Keith," the Captain said, after a moment's
silence, "I should be very loath to stand
in the way of your happiness,&mdash;still more of
that of my dear daughter; but the time is so far
off that we need not discuss the question now.
My little girl seems still the merest child, with
no thought of the cares, pleasures, and duties of
womanhood; and I wish to keep her so as long
as I can. That is one reason why I rejoice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>being able to educate her myself in our own
home; and thus far the loves of the dear ones in
it have seemed all-sufficient for her happiness.
And I own to being particularly pleased with
her oft-repeated assurance that she loves Papa
better than she does any one else in all the wide
world."</p>

<p>"Ah, I do not wonder that she does, for her
father is altogether worthy of all the love she can
give him!" Keith said, with a half-sigh, thinking
of the loneliness of his lot compared with that of
the Captain.</p>

<p>"Keith," the Captain said, after a moment's
silence, "you tell me your furlough will not expire
for some weeks yet. Can you not spend
them with us at the sea-shore?"</p>

<p>Donald demurred a little at first, saying he
had made other plans; and besides, his going
might interfere with his cousins' arrangements.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest danger of that," the Captain
averred; "and I am certain that one and
all will be delighted to see you."</p>

<p>"And I own to being fairly hungry for a sight
of them," laughed Donald. "So, Raymond,
your invitation is accepted, and on your own
head be the consequences."</p>

<p>"No objection to that; I'm delighted to have
you on any terms, reasonable or otherwise," the
Captain said, with his pleasant smile.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu had an hour or more of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>good refreshing sleep before the two gentlemen
separated for the night.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond went very softly into Lulu's
room, and stood for a moment by the bedside
looking fondly down into the rosy, sleeping face,
then, bending over her, kissed her tenderly on
cheek and lip and brow.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide and looked up into his,
while a glad smile broke over her face.</p>

<p>"You dear, good Papa, to come in and kiss
me again!" she said, putting her arm round his
neck and returning his caresses. "Oh, I do
think I have just the very dearest, kindest, best
father in the whole wide world!"</p>

<p>"That's rather strong, isn't it?" he returned,
laughing, but at the same time gathering
her up in his arms for a moment's petting
and fondling. Then, laying her down again,
"I did not mean to wake you," he said; "and
I want you now to go to sleep again as fast
as you can, because, though to-morrow will, I
hope, be a very enjoyable day to you and Max,
it is probable you will find it quite fatiguing
also."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I don't mean to think about it
now, else I'd be wide awake presently, and maybe
not sleep any more to-night," Lulu answered
drowsily, her eyes closing while she spoke.</p>

<p>He was turning away, when she roused sufficiently
to ask another question. "Papa, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>you please wake me when the time comes to
get up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter," he replied. "Do not let
the fear of not waking in season rob you of a
moment's sleep. I think you may safely trust to
your father to attend to that for you."</p>

<p>It seemed to Lulu that but a few moments had
passed when her father's voice spoke again close
to her side.</p>

<p>"Wake up now, little daughter, if you want
to go with Papa and Max to see what the cadets
will be doing in their camp for the next hour
or so."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, I do!" she cried, wide
awake in an instant. "Good-morning; and
thank you ever so much for calling me, dear
Papa!" and with the words her arms were round
his neck, her kisses on his cheek.</p>

<p>He gave her a hearty embrace in turn; and
then, with a "Now, my darling, you must make
haste, we have only ten minutes; but I shall
bring you back to rearrange your toilet before
going down to breakfast," he released her and
went back to his own room.</p>

<p>Lulu made quick work of her dressing, and
when her father tapped at her door to say it was
time to go, was quite ready.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Keith waiting on the porch,
exchanged a pleasant "good-morning" with him,
and at once started for the camp.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>Max and Lulu were in gayest spirits, and were
allowed to laugh and talk till the little party
drew near the camp, when their father bade
them be quiet, and amuse themselves for the
present by looking and listening.</p>

<p>He spoke in a kind, pleasant tone, and they
obeyed at once.</p>

<p>Down by the guard-tents they could see a dim,
drowsy gleam, as of a lantern; the gas-jets along
the way seemed to burn dimly, too, as the daylight
grew stronger, and up about the hill-tops
on the farther side of the river the sky was growing
rosy and bright with the coming day. But
all was so quiet, so still, where the tents were
that it seemed as if everybody there must be still
wrapped in slumber; and Lulu was beginning to
think Mr. Keith must have called for them a little
earlier than necessary, when a sudden gleam
and rattle among the trees almost made her
jump, so startled was she, while at the same
instant a stern, boyish voice called out, "Who
comes there?" and a sentry stood before them
wrapped in an overcoat,&mdash;for the morning was
very cool up there among the mountains,&mdash;and
with the dew dripping from his cap.</p>

<p>"Friends, with the countersign," replied Mr.
Keith.</p>

<p>"Halt, friends! Advance one with the countersign,"
commanded the sentry; and while the
Captain and his children stood still where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>were, Mr. Keith stepped up to the levelled bayonet
and whispered a word or two in the ear of
the young sentinel which at once caused a change
in his attitude toward our party,&mdash;respectful attention
taking the place of the fierce suspicion.
"Advance, friends!" he said, bringing his heels
together and his rifle to the carry, then stood like
a statue while they passed on into the camp he
guarded.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu, remembering their father's
order to them to keep quiet, said nothing, but
were careful to make the very best use of their
eyes.</p>

<p>Down by the tents, on the south and east sides,
they could see sentries pacing their rounds, but
there was as yet no sound or movement among
the occupants.</p>

<p>Some drummer-boys were hurrying over the
plain toward the camp, while a corporal and two
cadets were silently crossing to the northeast
corner, where stood a field-piece dripping with
dew.</p>

<p>Max motioned to Lulu to notice what they
were doing, and as he did so they had reached
the gun, and there was a dull thud as they
rammed home their cartridge.</p>

<p>The drummer-boys were chattering together in
low tones, glancing now and again at the clock
in the "Academic" tower over on the other side
of the plain. Suddenly a mellow stroke began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>to tell the hour, but the next was drowned in the
roar of the gun as it belched forth fire and smoke,
while at the same instant drum and fife broke
forth in the stirring strains of the reveille.</p>

<p>Lulu almost danced with delight, looking up
into her father's face with eyes shining with
pleasure. His answering smile was both fond
and indulgent as he took the small white hand
in his with a loving clasp; but it was no time
for words amid the thunder of the drums playing
their march in and about the camp.</p>

<p>Lulu could see the tent-flaps raised, drowsy
heads peering out, then dozens of erect, slender
lads, in white trousers and tight-fitting coatees,
coming out with buckets, and hurrying away to
the water-tanks and back again.</p>

<p>Presently the drums and fifes ceased their
music; there was a brief interval of silence,
while the streets of the camp filled up with gray
and white coated figures. Then came another
rattle of the drums like a sharp, quick, imperative
call.</p>

<p>"Fall in!" ordered the sergeants; and like
a flash each company sprang into two long
columns.</p>

<p>"Left face!" ordered each first sergeant,
while the second sergeant, answering to his own
name, was watching with eagle eye a delinquent
who came hurrying on, and took his place in the
ranks too late by a full half-second.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah," exclaimed Keith, "that poor lad will
be reported as too late at reveille!"</p>

<p>Lulu gave him a look of surprise. "Dear
me," she said to herself, "if Papa was that
strict with his children what ever would become
of me?"</p>

<p>But the first sergeant was calling the roll, and
she listened with fresh astonishment as he rattled
off the seventy or eighty names without
so much as an instant's pause, using no list, and
seeming to recognize each lad as he answered
"Here."</p>

<p>It took scarcely a minute; then at a single
word the ranks scattered, the lads hurrying away
to their tents, while the first sergeant made a
brief report to the captain, who stood near, then
the captain to the officer of the day.</p>

<p>Our little party had now seated themselves
where a good view of the camp might be obtained,
and Max and Lulu watched with great
interest what was going on there. They could
see the lads pull off their gray coats, raise their
tent-walls to give free circulation through them
to the sweet morning air, pile up their bedding,
and sweep their floors.</p>

<p>Lulu gave her father an inquiring look, and he
said, "What is it, daughter? You may talk
now, if you wish."</p>

<p>"I was just wondering if you had to do such
work as that at Annapolis," she said in reply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>"I did," he responded, with a smile, "and
thought you had heard me speak of it."</p>

<p>"Maybe I have," she said, with a tone and
look as if trying to recall something in the past.
"Oh, yes, I do remember it now! And I suppose
that's the reason you have always been so
particular with us about keeping our rooms nice
and neat."</p>

<p>"Partly, I believe," he returned, softly patting
the hand she had laid on his knee; "but
my mother was very neat and orderly, and from
my earliest childhood tried to teach me to be the
same."</p>

<p>"And I think I'll find it easier because of your
teachings, sir," remarked Max.</p>

<p>"I hope so," the Captain said; "you'll find
you have enough to learn, my boy, without
that."</p>

<p>"A good father is a great blessing, Max, as
I have found in my own experience," said Mr.
Keith.</p>

<p>But the roll of the drums began again, now
playing "Pease upon a Trencher;" again the
ranks were formed, rolls called; the sergeants
marched their companies to the colour line, officers
took their stations; first captain ordered
attention, swung the battalion into column of
platoons to the left, ordered "Forward, guide
right, march!" and away they went, to the stirring
music of the fifes and drums, away across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>the plain till the main road was reached, down
the shaded lane between the old "Academic"
and the chapel, past the new quarters, and the
grassy terrace beyond. Then each platoon
wheeled in succession to the right, mounted the
broad stone steps, and disappeared beneath the
portals of the mess hall.</p>

<p>Our party, who had followed at so slight a
distance as to be able to keep the cadets in
sight to the door of entrance, did not attempt
to look in upon them at their meal, but hurried
on to the hotel to give attention to their
own breakfasts,&mdash;the keen morning air and the
exercise of walking having bestowed upon each
one an excellent appetite.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu were very eager to "get back
in time to see everything," as they expressed it,
so began eating in great haste.</p>

<p>Their father gently admonished them to be
more deliberate.</p>

<p>"You must not forget," he said, "that food
must be thoroughly masticated in order to digest
properly; and those who indulge in eating at
such a rapid rate will be very likely soon to
suffer from indigestion."</p>

<p>"And we may as well take our time," added
Mr. Keith, "for it will be an hour or more before
anything of special interest will be going on
among the cadets."</p>

<p>"What do they do next, sir?" asked Max.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>"Morning drill, which is not very interesting,
comes next; then the tents are put in order."</p>

<p>"That must take a good while," remarked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"From three to five minutes, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried in surprise; "how can they
do it so quickly? I'm sure I couldn't put my
room at home in good order in less than ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"But, then, you're not a boy, you know,"
laughed Max.</p>

<p>"I'm quite as smart as if I were," she returned
promptly. "Isn't that so, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I have known some boys who were not particularly
bright," he answered, with an amused
look. "Perhaps you might compare quite favourably
with them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" she exclaimed; "is that the
best you can say about me?"</p>

<p>"I can say that my daughter seems to me to
have as much brain as my son, and of as good
quality," he replied kindly, refilling her plate as
he spoke; "and I very much doubt his ability
to put a room in order more rapidly than
she can, and at the same time equally well," he
concluded.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sort of womanish work anyhow,&mdash;isn't
it, Papa?" queried Max, giving Lulu
another laughing look.</p>

<p>"I don't see it so," replied his father. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>would be sorry to admit, or to think, that women
have a monopoly of the good qualities of
order and cleanliness."</p>

<p>"I, too, sir," said Max; "and I'm quite resolved
to do my father credit in that line as well
as others, at the academy and elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Are we going at once, Papa?" Lulu asked
as they left the table.</p>

<p>"No; but probably in ten or fifteen minutes.
Can you wait so long as that?" he asked, with a
humorous smile, and softly smoothing her hair
as she stood by his side.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" she answered brightly. "I
hope I'm not quite so impatient as I used to be;
and I feel quite sure you'll not let Max or me
miss anything very interesting or important."</p>

<p>"Not if I can well help it, daughter," he said.
"I want you and Max to see and hear all that I
think will be instructive, or give you pleasure."</p>

<p>A few moments later they set out; and they
had just reached the grove up by the guard-tents,
and seated themselves comfortably, when the
drum tapped for morning parade, and the cadets
were seen issuing from their tents, buttoned to
the throat in faultlessly fitting uniforms, their
collars, cuffs, gloves, belts, and trousers of spotless
white, their rifles, and every bit of metal
about them gleaming with polish.</p>

<p>"How fine the fellows do look, Lu!" remarked
Max, in an undertone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," she replied; "they couldn't be neater
if they were girls."</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," he returned, with
a laugh. "Oh, see! yonder comes the band.
Now we'll soon have some music."</p>

<p>"And there come some officers," said Lulu;
and as she spoke the sentry on No. 1 rattled his
piece, with a shout that re-echoed from the hills,
"Turn out the guard, Commandant of Cadets!"
and instantly the members of the guard were
seen hastily to snatch their rifles from the racks,
form ranks, and present arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maxie, isn't that fine!" whispered
Lulu, ecstatically. "Wouldn't you like to be
that officer?"</p>

<p>"I'd ten times rather be captain of a good
ship," returned Max.</p>

<p>"I believe I'd rather be in the navy, too, if I
were a boy," she said; "but I'd like the army
next best."</p>

<p>"Yes, so would I."</p>

<p>But the drum again tapped sharply, the cadets
in each street resolved themselves into two long
parallel lines, elbow to elbow, and at the last
tap faced suddenly outward, while the glistening
rifles sprang up to "support arms;" every first
sergeant called off his roll, every man as he answered
to his name snapping down his piece to
the "carry" and "order."</p>

<p>That done, the sergeant faced his captain, saluting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>in soldierly fashion, and took his post; the
captain whipped out his shining sword; the lieutenants
stepped to their posts.</p>

<p>"This is the morning inspection," Mr. Keith
said in reply to an inquiring look from Max and
Lulu.</p>

<p>"Are they very particular, sir?" queried
Max.</p>

<p>"Very; should a speck of rust be found on a
cadet's rifle, a single button missing from his
clothing, or unfastened, a spot on his trousers,
a rip or tear in his gloves, or dust on his shoes,
it is likely to be noted on the company delinquency-book
to-day, and published to the battalion
to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they're as strict and hard on a
fellow as that at Annapolis," thought Max to
himself. "I mean to ask Papa about it."</p>

<p>The inspection was soon over.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Keith, "there'll be a moment's
breathing spell, then more music by the
band while the cadets go through some of their
exercises, which I think you will find well worth
looking at."</p>

<p>They did enjoy it extremely,&mdash;the music, the
man&oelig;uvres of the cadets under the orders now
of the adjutant, and again of the officer in
command.</p>

<p>There followed a half-hour of rest, in which
Mr. Keith introduced his friend, Captain Raymond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>to some of the other officers, and they all
had a little chat together.</p>

<p>But as the clock struck nine the cadets were
again in ranks.</p>

<p>"What are they going to do now, Mr. Keith?"
asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"This is the hour for battery drill," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm glad we're going to see that!"
said Max. "I'd rather see it than anything
else."</p>

<p>"The cadets are dividing and going in different
directions," said Lulu. "Some of them seem
to be going down by the river."</p>

<p>"Yes; some members of the senior class.
They are going to what is called the 'sea-coast
battery' at the water's edge, and presently you
will hear the thunder of great guns coming from
there."</p>

<p>"Oh, can we go and look at them?" asked
Lulu, excitedly. "May we, Papa?" turning to
him.</p>

<p>"I think we shall have a finer sight up
here," he replied. "Am I not right, Mr.
Keith?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I think we would better remain where
we are. I would like you to see what daring
horsemen these youngsters are. See yonder are
the seniors in riding-dress, with gauntlets and
cavalry sabres. Watch how easily they mount,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and how perfectly at home they are upon their
steeds."</p>

<p>With intense interest and no little excitement
Max and Lulu watched and listened to all that
followed,&mdash;the rapid movements of column, line,
and battery, the flash of sabres, the belching of
flame and smoke, accompanied by the thundering
roar of the great guns, the stirring bugle blasts,
the rearing of the horses when brought to a sudden
halt. Even the gentlemen showed unmistakable
symptoms of interest and excitement.</p>

<p>The hour of battery drill passed very quickly.
When it was over the Captain called a carriage,
and he, Mr. Keith, Max, and Lulu drove from
one point of interest to another, occupying in
this way the time till the hour for the boat from
Albany to touch at the point. They took passage
on it to New York City, where they left it
to board a Sound steamer,&mdash;a few hours' journey
in which would take them to that part of
the sea-coast of Rhode Island which had been
selected as the summer resort of the family
connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>Early the next morning our party landed at
Newport, where they took a carriage for their
sea-side home. It was early when they arrived,
but they found everybody up, and ready with a
joyful welcome, in both that house and the
next two, occupied by the Dinsmores, Travillas,
and Lelands. The delight of all the Raymonds,
from the Captain down to the baby boy, was a
pretty thing to see.</p>

<p>The occupants of the other cottages were present,
and rejoiced with them; and from one and
all Cousin Donald received a very warm welcome.
They were evidently much pleased to see
him, and soon made him feel quite at home
among them.</p>

<p>They all sat down to breakfast together, almost
immediately upon the arrival of the travellers,
and lingered over the table in pleasant
chat, talking of what had occurred to one and
another during the absence of the Captain, Max,
and Lulu, questioning Cousin Donald in regard
to loved ones more nearly related to him
than to themselves, and laying plans for his and
their own entertainment during his stay among
them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>"I hope," remarked the Captain, "that some
naval vessel will come within reach, so that we
may have a chance to visit her in your company,
Donald."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I would greatly enjoy so doing,"
Donald answered. "I suppose a visit from such
a vessel is by no means rare in these parts at this
time of year."</p>

<p>"No," the Captain replied, glancing through a
window looking upon the sea, as he spoke. "Why,
there is one in plain view at this moment!" he
cried, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>They all hastily left the table and gathered
upon a porch which gave them a good view of
the sea and the man-of-war, hardly a mile away.</p>

<p>"My spy-glass, Max, my son," the Captain
said.</p>

<p>"Here, Papa," answered Max, putting it into
his father's hand. "I knew it would be wanted."</p>

<p>"Good boy," returned the Captain. "Ah,
yes," looking through the glass, "just as I
thought. It is the 'Wanita,' Captain Wade, an
old friend of mine; we were boys together in the
Naval Academy." His face shone with pleasure
as he spoke. "We must visit her," he added,
passing the glass to Donald.</p>

<p>Max and Lulu exchanged glances of delight,&mdash;Papa
was so kind and indulgent they were
almost sure he would take them along if he knew
they wished to go.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not to-day, Levis? I am sure you must be
too much fatigued with your long journey," Violet
said, with a look into her husband's eyes that
seemed to add, "I could not be content to part
from you for an hour just yet."</p>

<p>His answering look was as fond as her own.</p>

<p>"No, dearest," he said, low and tenderly,
"nor do I intend to go at all without my little
wife, unless she absolutely refuses to accompany
me; we will stay quietly at home to-day, if you
wish, and perhaps visit the 'Wanita' to-morrow."</p>

<p>It was a bit of private chat, the others being
quite engrossed with the 'Wanita,' taking turns in
gazing upon her through the glass.</p>

<p>The next moment Lulu was by her father's
side, asking in eager beseeching tones, "Papa,
if you go on board that war vessel won't you take
Max and me with you?"</p>

<p>"I think it highly probable, in case you should
both wish to go," he said, smiling at the look of
entreaty in her face and its sudden change to one
of extreme delight as she heard his reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, thank you ever so much!" she
cried, fairly dancing with delight. "There's
nothing I'd like better; and I hope we can
all go."</p>

<p>"You would enjoy it, my dear?" asked the
Captain, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>"I would enjoy going anywhere with you,
Levis; and your company is particularly desirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>on a man-of-war," Violet answered with a happy
laugh.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he returned, with a bow and
smile. "We must have them&mdash;Wade and his
officers&mdash;here too. It will be a pleasure to entertain
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, how delightful!" cried Lulu,
clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, my child, let me advise you not to be
too much elated," laughed her father; "they may
have or receive orders to leave this port for some
other before our plan can be carried out."</p>

<p>"What plan is it?" "To what do you refer,
Captain?" asked several voices; for nearly
every one had now taken a look at the man-of-war,
and was ready to give attention to something
else.</p>

<p>The Captain explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful!" exclaimed Zoe. "Will
it be a dinner, tea, or evening party, Captain?"</p>

<p>"That question remains open to discussion,
Sister Zoe," he returned, with a twinkle of fun
in his eye. "What would you advise?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said laughingly, "I am not prepared
to answer that question yet."</p>

<p>Then the others joined in with proposals and
suggestions, but nothing was positively decided
upon just at that time.</p>

<p>The day was spent restfully in wandering along
the shore, sitting on the beach or the cottage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>porches, chatting and gazing out over the sea, or
napping,&mdash;most of the last-named being done by
the lately returned travellers.</p>

<p>The little girls of the family, occasionally
joined by Max Raymond and Walter Travilla,
spent much of the day together, rather apart
from their elders,&mdash;Lulu most of the time
giving an account of her trip out West and
weeks of sojourn in the town of Minersville,
the acquaintances she had made, and all that
had happened during the stay there, especially
of the sad occurrence which so seriously
marred the enjoyment of the last days
of their visit, Max now and then taking part
in the narrative.</p>

<p>Both had a great deal to tell about West
Point and Saratoga, and the places of historical
interest in their vicinity. Evidently the
trip to the far West and back again, with their
father, had been one of keen enjoyment to
both of them.</p>

<p>So the day passed and evening drew on. The
little ones were in bed, the others all gathered
upon the porches enjoying the delicious sea-breeze,
and the view of the rolling waves, crested
with foam, and looking like molten silver where
the moonbeams fell full upon them.</p>

<p>Every one seemed gay and happy, and there
was a good deal of cheerful chat, particularly
on the porch of the Raymond cottage, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>were Grandma Elsie, Edward Travilla, Donald
Keith, the Captain, with Violet and his older
children, and some of the other young persons.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching wheels attracted
their attention. A carriage drew up in front of
the house, and from it alighted a gentleman in
the uniform of a captain in the navy.</p>

<p>"Wade!" exclaimed Captain Raymond, hurrying
out to meet him. "My dear friend, this is
very kind in you. I had hardly hoped to see
you until to-morrow, and not then without hunting
you up. You are as welcome as this delicious
sea-breeze."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Raymond, that's quite a compliment,"
laughed the other, shaking hands heartily;
"but I deserve no thanks, as I came quite as
much for my own satisfaction as for yours. I
understand you have been here for some weeks,
but I only heard of it accidentally this morning."</p>

<p>"But it was only this morning I arrived,"
Captain Raymond said in a tone of amusement;
then, as they had stepped into the midst of the
group upon the porch, he proceeded to introduce
his friend to the ladies and gentlemen composing
it.</p>

<p>There followed an hour of lively, pleasant
chat, during which Captain Wade made acquaintance
with not only the grown people, but the
younger ones also, seeming to take a great deal
of interest in them,&mdash;Max especially,&mdash;listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>with attention and evident sympathy as Captain
Raymond told of his son's prospect of soon becoming
a naval cadet.</p>

<p>"You have my best wishes, Max," said Captain
Wade. "I hope to live to see you a naval
officer as brave, talented, and as much beloved as
your father was, and still is."</p>

<p>Max's eyes sparkled, and turned upon his
father with a look of deepest respect and affection
as he replied, "I could ask nothing better
than that, sir, I am sure."</p>

<p>"And I could wish you nothing better than
that you may prove a son worthy of such a
father," returned Captain Wade. "I have known
him since he was a boy of your age, and never
knew him to be guilty of a mean or dishonourable
act."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Max, his cheeks flushing,
and his eyes again seeking his father's face
with a look of reverence and filial love; "it is
very kind in you to tell me that, though it's no
news to me that I'm so fortunate as to be the
son of a man any boy might be proud to own
as his father."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Max!" exclaimed Mr. Keith, with a
pleased laugh. "I like to hear a boy talk in that
way of his father, and certainly you have a good
right to do so."</p>

<p>"No boy ever had a better right than Max has
to speak well of his father," remarked Violet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>lightly, but with an earnest undertone in her
sweet voice, "and no one is more capable of
judging of that than I, who have lived with them
both for years."</p>

<p>"And no one could speak too well of Papa,"
said Lulu, with impulsive warmth, "for there
couldn't be a better man than he is."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to believe that, little daughter,"
he said, putting an arm round her as she
stood close at his side. Then he changed the
subject of conversation.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Captain Wade took leave,
giving all a cordial invitation to return his call
by a visit to the "Wanita."</p>

<p>"We had talked of giving you a call to-morrow,"
said Captain Raymond, "but that
would be a very prompt return of your visit."</p>

<p>"None too prompt," returned Wade. "Our
time here together, Raymond, is likely to be
all too short, and we would better make the
most of it."</p>

<p>"So I think," returned the person addressed;
"and I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing
you here frequently."</p>

<p>"I think he's just as nice as he can be," remarked
Rosie Travilla, as the carriage drove
away with Captain Wade, "and I hope he'll
visit us again soon."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Lulu, "I believe naval officers
are the very nicest gentlemen in the world."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>"That's rather strong, isn't it?" laughed her
father; "and as you have made the acquaintance
of only two or three in the course of your life,
I fear you are hardly a competent judge."</p>

<p>"And what of army officers, my little lady?"
asked Donald Keith, with a good-humoured laugh.
"Have you nothing to say for them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" she said. "I forgot them at
the moment, and I do really think they are <em>almost</em>
equal to the naval ones."</p>

<p>"Almost!" he repeated. "Well, even that
is saying a good deal for us if your father is a
fair sample of those belonging to the navy."</p>

<p>But it was growing late, and the little party
soon separated for the night.</p>

<p>Lulu was nearly ready for bed when her father
came to her room to bid her good-night in the old
way she liked so much. He took her in his arms
with a fond caress, asking, "Does it seem pleasant
to be at home&mdash;or with the home folks&mdash;again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Papa," she answered, putting
an arm about his neck and laying her cheek
to his, "but you are always a great deal more
than half of home to me. Oh, I do love you so
dearly!"</p>

<p>"And I you, my own darling," her father
replied, caressing her again and again.</p>

<p>"I'd rather have you to love me, Papa, than
have all the money in the world without you, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>with a father that didn't care much about me,"
she continued.</p>

<p>"Dear child," he said in tender tones, "I
value you, and each one of my children, more
than words can express. Now I must bid you
good-night, for you need all the sleep you can
get between this and sunrise."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, "I do hope to-morrow
will be clear, so we can go to see the 'Wanita;'
or at least that it won't rain. Perhaps it would
be all the pleasanter for a few clouds to keep the
sun from being so hot on us."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he replied; "but we must take
the weather our heavenly Father sends, and be
content and thankful."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'll try to do so; but I do hope it
will be such that we can go."</p>

<p>"I hope it will, daughter; but if you should
have to give up the trip for the time, I hope and
expect to see you do so pleasantly,&mdash;which you
well may, considering that we are very likely to
have other opportunities."</p>

<p>"Well, if anything should happen to keep
me at home, and I'm cross or sulky about it, I
just hope you'll punish me well for my naughtiness,"
she said so earnestly that he could scarcely
refrain from smiling.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that in that case I should punish
myself quite as much as you," he said, giving
her another hug. "My dear child, if you care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>at all for Papa's happiness,&mdash;as I am sure you
do,&mdash;try to be so good that he will never have
the pain of inflicting any kind of punishment
upon you."</p>

<p>Then he bade her good-night, and left her to
her rest.</p>

<p>Lulu's head was scarcely on the pillow before
she was fast asleep. When she woke, it was already
broad daylight. She sprang up and ran to
the window to take an observation of the weather.</p>

<p>"Cloudy, but not raining," she said, half-aloud.
"Just as I'd like to have it, if only it
will keep so, and not turn to actual rain."</p>

<p>With that she began making a rapid toilet,
thinking she would like to take a little run on
the beach before the summons to breakfast;
but when she reached the porch below, the rain
was falling pretty fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she sighed, "why couldn't it
keep off for a few hours longer?"</p>

<p>"What, daughter,&mdash;the rain?" asked her
father's voice close at her side, while his hand
was laid caressingly upon her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, good-morning, Papa!" she returned,
lifting to his a sorely disappointed face. "I
didn't know you were here. Yes, sir, it is the
rain I'm mourning over,&mdash;I do so want to visit
that man-of-war to-day; it's really a great disappointment!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you should feel it so!" he returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>in a sympathizing tone; "but we won't
despair yet. I think this is but a passing shower,
which will make the trip all the more enjoyable
by cooling the air nicely for us. However, should
it prove too inclement for our contemplated little
jaunt, we must try to remember that our kind
and loving heavenly Father orders all these
things, and to be patient and content,&mdash;more
than content, thankful for whatever He sends!"</p>

<p>"I'll try to be content and thankful, Papa;
I certainly ought, when I have so many, <em>many</em>
blessings, and don't really deserve any of them,"
she answered, putting her hand into his, and letting
him lead her back and forth along the porch,
which they had to themselves for the time.</p>

<p>"No; that is true of each one of us," he said.
"Did you sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Just as well as possible, Papa," she answered,
smiling up into his face. "I didn't
know anything from the time my head touched
the pillow till I woke to find it broad daylight."</p>

<p>"That is something to be very thankful for,
daughter, as you will discover should sickness
and pain ever give you long hours of wakefulness,
such as fall to the lot of many a poor
sufferer."</p>

<p>"I hope that time will never come to either of
us, Papa," she said; "but I'd rather it would
come to me than to you. Oh, it was so hard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>see you suffer that time you were sick here, and
that other time, when Thunderer threw you!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I shall never forget how tenderly affectionate
and helpful my children were to me then,"
he said, with a look and smile that made her heart
bound.</p>

<p>Now others of the family began to join them.
Mr. Keith came out upon the porch too, and
after exchanging a good-morning with those
who had preceded him, remarked that it seemed
doubtful if they would be able to take their proposed
trip to visit Captain Wade and his man-of-war.
But by the time breakfast and family
worship were over, the clouds began to scatter;
and in another hour the carriages were at the
door ready to convey them to the wharf, whence
a boat would take them to the "Wanita."</p>

<p>Every one did not care to go that day; the
party consisted of Grandma Elsie, Edward, Zoe,
Rosie Travilla, Evelyn Leland, Mr. Keith, and
the Raymonds, not including the very little
ones, who were left at home in the care of their
nurse.</p>

<p>It was pronounced by all a most enjoyable little
excursion. The weather proved favourable,
clouds obscuring the sun, but no rain falling;
the officers of the "Wanita" were very polite
and attentive, taking them about the vessel, and
showing them everything likely to interest ladies
and children.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>They, particularly Grandma Elsie and Violet,
were charmed with the perfect neatness everywhere
noticeable; the decks, the store-rooms,
the magazine and shell rooms, the passages, the
engine and fire rooms (into which they took a
peep),&mdash;indeed, all parts of the vessel shown
them,&mdash;were most beautifully neat and clean.</p>

<p>The battery, which contained some new guns,
seemed to interest Captain Raymond and Mr.
Keith more than anything else, while the ladies
and little girls greatly admired their brilliant
polish.</p>

<p>When they returned to the shore there was still
time for a delightful drive before dinner, which
they took,&mdash;the best hour for bathing coming in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Captain Wade and his officers took dinner and
tea with them the next day by invitation. A
great interest in the navy had been aroused in
the breasts of the young people, and they
watched the officers furtively, and listened with
attention to all they said that had any bearing
upon that subject.</p>

<p>Max was more and more in love with the prospect
before him, and quite resolved to make the
very best of his opportunities should he be so
fortunate as to gain admission to the Naval
Academy.</p>

<p>His father had told him he might have this
week entirely for recreation, but on the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Monday must begin to review his studies preparatory
to the examination he would be called
upon to pass through at Annapolis.</p>

<p>"I'm very willing, Papa," he replied. "I've
had a long and delightful vacation already out
West with you; and as I'm very anxious to pass
as good an examination as possible, I want to
study hard to get ready for it. And I think it's
ever so kind in you to help me by hearing my
lessons."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," the Captain said, with a
pleased look, "make the most of your holidays
while they last, though I do not mean that it
shall be all work and no play even after this
week; a couple of hours given to study each day
will probably be all-sufficient."</p>

<p>"And may I get up early and take them before
breakfast when I choose, sir?" Max asked
in an eager tone, that told how delightful he
would esteem it to be ready to join in the pastimes
of the rest of their party,&mdash;driving, boating,
fishing, bathing, and strolling along the beach
and through the woods.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, if you can manage to get
enough sleep in season for that," the Captain
replied in an indulgent tone.</p>

<p>"I think I can, sir," said the boy. "I'll take
an afternoon <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">siesta</i> if I don't get enough sleep
without."</p>

<p>"That will do," said his father. "Remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>health and study must be well attended to, and
the more fun and frolic you can manage to get
besides, the better I shall be pleased."</p>

<p>Bent on carrying out his plan, Max went early
to bed Sunday night, and was up at his books
working hard for a couple of hours before breakfast.
It still wanted fifteen or twenty minutes of
that time when he went down to the porch with
his book in his hand.</p>

<p>His father was alone there, looking over the
morning paper.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Papa," Max said. "I am
ready to recite whenever you want to hear me."</p>

<p>"Ah! are you, indeed?" the Captain said,
taking the book; "then I shall hear this lesson
at once."</p>

<p>Max recited very creditably. His father commended
him kindly, then said, "I am going in to
the city directly after we have had breakfast and
family worship, and shall take you with me if you
would like to go."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; indeed I would!" returned
Max, his eyes shining, for he esteemed it one of
his greatest pleasures and privileges to be permitted
to go anywhere with his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you will enjoy it," the Captain
said, smiling to see how pleased the boy was; "I
have an errand which I shall tell to no one but
Cousin Donald and you. See here," pointing to an
advertisement in the paper he had been reading.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>"A yacht for sale!" exclaimed Max; "Oh,
Papa, are you going to buy it?"</p>

<p>"That is a question I am not prepared to
answer till I have seen it, my boy," replied his
father. "I shall take you and Cousin Donald,
if he will go, to look at it and help me to decide
whether to buy it or not."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith joined them at that moment, and
was greeted with a pleasant good-morning and
shown the advertisement, the Captain telling him
that if the yacht proved such as he would like
to own, he meant to buy it, and if the plan was
agreeable to his wife, to spend the rest of the
summer on board, taking his family and friends
with him, making short voyages along the coast
and perhaps some distance out to sea.</p>

<p>"Taking the opportunity to give my son some
lessons in navigation," he added, with a smiling
glance at Max.</p>

<p>"Papa! I couldn't ask anything better!" exclaimed
Max, hardly able to contain his delight.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it, my boy," his father
said. "But now remember that our errand is
a secret between us three until we return from
the city."</p>

<p>"Then you'll tell Mamma Vi and the rest,
sir?" asked Max.</p>

<p>"If I have made the purchase, yes."</p>

<p>The call to breakfast came at that moment and
was promptly obeyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Max could hardly eat, so excited was he over
the prospect of going to the city with his father
on so delightful an errand, but he said not a
word on the subject.</p>

<p>The coachman had been given his order in good
season, and by the time family prayers were over
the carriage and horses were at the gate.</p>

<p>"My dear," Captain Raymond said to Violet,
"a business matter calls me to the city, but I
hope to return in season to take my wife in
bathing, or out driving, or wherever she may
wish to go."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," she said, smiling up into
his eyes; "I'll try to be ready for either by the
time you return. But is not this a sudden move?
I had heard nothing of it before."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; but as I am in some haste,
I must defer my explanation until I get home
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't ask for an explanation," she returned
laughingly, as he gave her a hasty good-by
kiss; "you have always been so good since
my first acquaintance with you, that I am quite
sure you may be trusted."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm much obliged for your good opinion,"
he answered, with a twinkle of fun in his
eye, as he hastily kissed the children, then hurried
with Donald and Max to the carriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The "Dolphin" proved a trim little craft,
beautifully finished and furnished, a schooner-rigged
sailing-yacht, gracefully modelled and
nearly new; but her former owner had died,
and the yacht was to be sold as a necessary
measure for the settling of the estate.</p>

<p>Max went into raptures over her; and the Captain
was evidently pleased, though he said very
little as he went about examining every part of
her with keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Isn't she all right, Papa?" Max at length
ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"I think she is, my son," was the prompt,
pleasant-toned reply. "What is your opinion,
Keith?"</p>

<p>"It exactly coincides with yours, Raymond;
and if I wanted, and could afford so expensive a
luxury, I think I shouldn't hesitate to make an
offer for her."</p>

<p>"We seem to be quite agreed in our estimate
of her," said Captain Raymond; "and I shall
take your advice."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure of her speed?" queried
Keith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes; I have seen accounts of her in the
papers, showing that she is a fine sailer, as I
should feel confident she would be, judging
merely from her appearance. She is a beautifully
modelled, well-built little craft."</p>

<p>"Looks rather small to you after the naval
vessels you were wont to command?" queried
Donald Keith, with a good-humoured laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes; but quite captivating to a lover of
the sea, nevertheless, and as I see she is such
to Max, and have no doubt that she will be to
the rest of my family, I am about decided to
make the purchase."</p>

<p>Max drew a long breath, while his eyes sparkled
with pleasure.</p>

<p>They at once sought the agent whose business
it was to attend to the sale of the vessel. It did
not take long for him and the Captain to come
to an agreement; and the "Dolphin" quickly
changed owners.</p>

<p>Max was enraptured, his cheeks glowing, his
eyes fairly dancing with delight. He managed,
with some difficulty, to keep quiet till they were
in the carriage again on the way home, then
burst out, "Papa, I think it's just splendid
that you're the owner of such a beautiful vessel!
And I hope to learn a great deal about the proper
management of one while we're sailing round
in her."</p>

<p>"I shall try to teach you all I can, my boy,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>was his father's smiling reply; "and your pleasure
in the purchase doubles my own."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Max. "I intend to
pay good heed to your instructions, and learn as
much as possible, so that I may pass a good examination
at Annapolis, and do my father credit."</p>

<p>"But, Max, you might do him as much credit
in the army as in the navy; and how you could
resist the fascinations of West Point, I don't
see," remarked Donald Keith, with a twinkle of
fun in his eye.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I suppose it's because I am the
son of a seaman; love for the sea runs in the
blood,&mdash;isn't that so, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Altogether likely," laughed the Captain. "I
have been supposed to inherit it from my father,
and he from his."</p>

<p>Violet, and the other members of the family,
with some of the relatives from the adjacent cottages,
were all on the porch as the carriage drew
up in front of the house, and its occupants
alighted.</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!" shouted little Elsie and the
baby boy, running to meet him.</p>

<p>"Papa's darlings!" the Captain said, stooping
to caress and fondle them; then, taking them
in his arms, he followed Donald up the porch-steps,
Max close in his rear.</p>

<p>"Take a seat, Cousin Donald," said Violet.
"We are glad to see you all back again. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>been wondering, my dear, what important business
you had to keep you so long away from me
and your children."</p>

<p>"It was rather important," returned the Captain,
pleasantly. "Max," with an indulgent
smile into the lad's eager face, "you may have
the pleasure of telling where we have been and
what we have done."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir!" cried Max, and proceeded
to avail himself of the permission, going
into an enthusiastic description of the beautiful
"Dolphin," and winding up with the news that
Papa had bought her, and expected to take their
whole party&mdash;or, at least, as many of them as
would like to go&mdash;coasting along the shores of
all the Atlantic States of New England, and for
some distance out to sea.</p>

<p>Lulu was dancing with delight, hugging and
kissing her father in a transport of joy, before
Max's story came to an end.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, how good,&mdash;how good and kind
you are!" she exclaimed. "I don't think anything
could be pleasanter than such a trip as
that. It'll be the greatest fun that ever was.
And you'll command the vessel yourself, won't
you? I do hope so; for I am sure nobody else
could do it half so well."</p>

<p>"What a flatterer my eldest daughter can
show herself to be!" he said, with a good-humoured
laugh. "Yes, I do expect to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>command of the dainty little craft,&mdash;a small
affair, indeed, compared with a man-of-war.
My dear," turning to Violet, "we have yet to
hear from you on this subject. I hope you
approve of your husband's purchase."</p>

<p>"Entirely, Levis. In fact, I am quite as much
delighted as Lulu seems to be," she answered,
smiling up into his face. "What could be more
enjoyable than sailing about in such a vessel,
with a retired naval officer in command? When
am I to see your 'Dolphin'?"</p>

<p>"Yours quite as much as mine, my dear,"
he replied. "You have only to say the word
at any time, and I will take you over to look
at her."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you?" she exclaimed. "Then suppose
we all go over this afternoon, and see what
she is like."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" the Captain said; then glancing
round at the eager faces, "How many of you
would like to go with us?" he asked.</p>

<p>He was answered by a prompt and unanimous
acceptance of his invitation. They all wanted to
see that beautiful "Dolphin;" and after a little
discussion of the matter, it was decided that they
would give up the bath for that day, and start
for Newport harbour immediately upon leaving
the dinner-table.</p>

<p>They made a very jovial party, and were delighted
with the vessel and the prospect of sailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>in her under the command of one so kind and
competent as her new owner.</p>

<p>For the next few days Captain Raymond was
busy with his preparations for the voyage,&mdash;engaging
a crew and getting everything on
board that would add to the comfort and enjoyment
of his family and guests; the ladies also
were occupied with theirs, which were not sufficiently
great to interfere with the usual pleasures
of a sojourn by the sea-side; then one
bright morning saw them all on board,&mdash;a
merry, happy party.</p>

<p>"Where are we going first, Papa?" asked Lulu,
when they were fairly under way.</p>

<p>"On a little trial trip along the coast," he
answered.</p>

<p>"And then coming back to Newport?" questioned
Gracie.</p>

<p>"Possibly," he said, with a smile into the
bright, eager face.</p>

<p>"I think I know, though I'm not right sure,"
Max said, looking at his father with a rather
mischievous twinkle in his eyes, "what Papa is
thinking about."</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" laughed his father.
"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I overheard Captain Wade telling
you he expected the rest of the squadron would
be in soon,&mdash;in a day or two, I think he said,&mdash;and
I have a notion it would be a fine sight for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>us all, and that my father kindly means to give
it to us."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! you seem to have a great deal
of confidence in your father's desire to give
pleasure to you all," laughed the Captain.
"Well, my boy, events may perhaps show
whether you are right."</p>

<p>The three had followed their father to a portion
of the deck at some little distance from the
rest of the party, so that their talk was not overheard
by them.</p>

<p>"A squadron?" repeated Grace. "What is
that? Oh, it's a good many ships belonging together,&mdash;isn't
it, Papa?"</p>

<p>"That will answer very well for a definition,
or description," he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am!" exclaimed Lulu,
clapping her hands in delight. "And will they
go through all their man&oelig;uvres, Papa?"</p>

<p>"As I am not the admiral whose orders are
to be obeyed, I cannot say exactly what will
be done, my child," the Captain replied. "I
can only say I intend to have you in the vicinity
in season to see all that may be done. Does that
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir! and I thank you very, very
much!" she said, taking his hand in both of hers
and squeezing it affectionately.</p>

<p>"I too, Papa," said Grace. "I'm sure we'll
enjoy it ever so much."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>"I hope so," he answered. "And now can
you three keep the secret from the others, that
they may have a pleasant surprise?"</p>

<p>"If we can't, or don't, I think we ought never
to be told a secret again," exclaimed Lulu, in her
vehement way.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would not be intrusted with one
very soon again," her father said; "but," he
added, with a look from one to the other of mingled
pride and affection, "I feel quite safe in
trusting a secret to the keeping of the eldest
three of my children. I am quite sure no one
of you would tell anything you knew your father
wished kept secret."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Papa!" said Max. "We would
certainly deserve to be severely punished, and
never trusted by you again, if we should ever so
abuse your confidence."</p>

<p>"Just what I think," said Lulu.</p>

<p>"I too," added Grace. "And, Papa, it's so
nice and kind in you to trust us!" looking up into
his face with a loving smile as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Is it?" he asked, smoothing her hair with
fond, caressing hand. "Well, my pet, it is a
very great pleasure to me to be able to do so."</p>

<p>At that moment they were joined by Mr. Keith.
The two gentlemen entered into conversation;
the two little girls ran down into the cabin to see
that the maid was making such disposition of
their effects as they desired; while Max, joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>by Walter Travilla, made the tour of the vessel
for perhaps the fiftieth time,&mdash;for ever since the
purchase, he had spent at least half of every
week-day there, learning from his father and others
all he could of her different parts and of her
management.</p>

<p>Walter, too, had been there again and again,
spending hours at a time in climbing about with
Max, who took much pleasure in handing over to
him the lessons just learned by himself.</p>

<p>The rest of the party were seated on deck
enjoying the breeze and the beauties of sea and
land,&mdash;for the latter was not yet out of sight,
though fast receding.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely, every one in the best
of spirits, the younger ones full of fun and
frolic, and the day passed most enjoyably to all.
The evening was enlivened by music from a
very sweet-toned piano in the cabin, by singing,
conversation, promenading the deck, and
gazing out over the water, watching the rise
and fall of the waves, and the passing of ships
and steamers.</p>

<p>But the day had been an exciting one, especially
to the children, and they were willing
enough to retire at an early hour. They gathered
on deck, each repeated a verse of Scripture,
after which they united in singing a hymn, and
Mr. Dinsmore led in prayer. Then the good-nights
were said, and all the young people, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>some of the older ones, retired to their pretty,
cosey state-rooms and their berths.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of nearly everybody
when, coming on deck the next morning, they discovered
that they were again in Narragansett Bay.
There were many exclamations and questions,
"How did it happen?" "Whose mistake was it
that instead of being away out at sea, we are
back at our starting-point again?" These and
other like queries were propounded to the owner
and commander of the yacht.</p>

<p>He pointed, with a good-humoured smile, to a
number of war-vessels lying quietly at anchor at
no very great distance.</p>

<p>"The squadron is in, you see; and I thought
my passengers would not like to miss the sight
of its evolutions, so brought them back to view
them. There will be time afterward for a pleasant
little voyage along the coast, or where you
will."</p>

<p>The explanation was entirely satisfactory to
every one, and there was great rejoicing among
the lads and lasses.</p>

<p>"What is it they're going to do, Papa?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"I have not been let into that secret, daughter,"
he answered; "but we may find out after
awhile by keeping a close watch upon their
movements."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, you can read their signals, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>tell us what's coming, can't you? Won't you?"
exclaimed Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, I can and will," he replied.
"But there is the call to breakfast, and you
needn't hurry through your meal; for they are
not likely, for some hours yet, to begin anything
you would want to see."</p>

<p>Encouraged by that assurance, no one cared
to make undue haste in eating all that appetite
called for of the excellent breakfast presently
set before them. But an hour later found them
all on deck, young and old keeping a sharp
watch on every movement of the vessels composing
the squadron, several spy-glasses being
constantly turned in their direction.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Captain, at length, while
at the same instant Max asked eagerly, "Papa,
what is it they are doing there on the 'Wanita'?"</p>

<p>"Getting ready for inspection by the Admiral,"
was the reply. "See, the men have donned their
uniforms and are taking their places on the deck.
And yonder&mdash;do you see?&mdash;the Admiral and
his staff are pushing off from the flag-ship."</p>

<p>The boatswain's whistle and the roll of a drum
were now heard coming from the "Wanita."</p>

<p>"Oh, and is that the executive officer on the
bridge of the 'Wanita,' Papa?" asked Max, excitedly.
"And what is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Giving an order to the gunner, doubtless to
fire a salute in honour of the Admiral."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>Before the words had fairly left the Captain's
lips, the loud boom of the first gun burst upon
the ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, Max, wouldn't you like to be in that
Admiral's place?" queried Walter Travilla; "I
would."</p>

<p>"Oh, our Maxie means to be an admiral one
of these days; and I'm sure I hope he will,"
said Rosie.</p>

<p>"Very good in you, Rosie," returned Max,
smiling and blushing; "but I'm afraid I'll be
an old man before that happens, if it ever
does."</p>

<p>"But you may comfort yourself that you can
be very useful in maintaining your country's
honour without waiting to be made an admiral,"
remarked Evelyn Leland, smiling pleasantly at
Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, returning the smile, "and it
<em>is</em> a comfort. We'd any of us feel it an honour
to be useful to our country."</p>

<p>"I'd like to be," remarked Gracie, "if little
girls could do anything."</p>

<p>"Little girls are sometimes a very great blessing
and comfort to their fathers," the Captain
said, smiling down into her eyes while he laid his
right hand tenderly on her pretty head, with its
sunny curls streaming in the wind.</p>

<p>In the mean while the firing of the salute had
gone on, the Admiral and his staff had reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>the deck of the "Wanita," the marines presenting
arms, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, what is he going to do now, Papa?"
queried Lulu,&mdash;"the Admiral, I mean."</p>

<p>"Inspect the ship," replied her father.</p>

<p>"What for, Papa?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"To see that every part of it is in perfect
order."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he will find it so," said Lulu; "for
when we were there and were taken all over it,
every part was as clean and neat as any lady's
parlour."</p>

<p>Captain Raymond now turned away and began
talking with Mr. Keith on some subject that did
not interest the children, but they continued a
close watch of the "Wanita."</p>

<p>The Admiral presently disappeared from the
deck, but at length they saw him there again,
talking with Captain Wade and his officers; then,
in a few moments he and his staff re-embarked
and returned to the flag-ship.</p>

<p>"What's going to be done now?" asked one
and another.</p>

<p>"Watch, and you will see presently," said
Captain Raymond. "If you do not wish to
miss something, I advise you to keep both eyes
and ears open."</p>

<p>The advice seemed to be promptly followed.
All eyes gazed intently in the direction of the
"Wanita" and the flag-ship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>Presently a signal was shown by the flag-ship
which Captain Raymond promptly interpreted
for the enlightenment of those about him,&mdash;"Abandon
ship."</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Papa?" asked
Grace.</p>

<p>"Look and see if you can't find out for yourself,"
he answered in a pleasant tone.</p>

<p>The signal seemed to have caused a commotion
on the deck of each vessel belonging to the
squadron. Then there was a great splashing of
boats into the water, and of other craft which the
Captain explained were life-rafts and catamarans;
while at the same time men and boys were
scampering about with various articles which he
said were provisions, nautical instruments, etc.,
such as would be needed if the ships were really
abandoned out at sea.</p>

<p>"But why would they ever do that, Papa?"
Grace asked wonderingly. "I should think it
would always be better to stay in their ships,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not always, daughter. The ship might be
on fire, or leaking so badly that she would be
in danger of sinking."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir! I didn't think of that," she
responded.</p>

<p>"Oh, see!" said Rosie; "they've all pushed
off away from their ships, and the 'Wanita's'
boats are ahead of all the others."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now what are they going to do, Papa?"
asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"I can tell that only when I see the flag-ship's
next signal," he replied. "Ah, there it is, and
tells them to go round the harbour under sail."</p>

<p>The children watched with interest and delight
as the order was obeyed. It was a very pretty
sight, but soon came another signal from the
flag-ship, which the Captain told them was one
of recall; and the boats returned to their ships.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>The squadron steamed out to sea, the "Dolphin"
keeping most of the time within sight of
the naval vessels, its passengers being anxious to
see more of the evolutions of the men-of-war, and
their commanding officer very willing to indulge
their wish. They were out simply for pleasure,
and were free to turn in any desired direction.</p>

<p>The weather was all that could possibly be
wished; and in the evening everybody was on
deck except the very little ones, who were
already in their nests. The vessels of the
squadron were in sight, and all eyes turned
frequently in their direction.</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll do anything to-night,
Papa?" asked Grace, taking possession of her
father's knee, for at the moment he was sitting
among the others.</p>

<p>"Who, daughter?" he asked, smoothing her
hair with caressing hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Admiral and the rest of them on those
war-ships. What do they do at such times when
they seem to be sailing around just for pleasure?"</p>

<p>"I rather think it is for profit too," he said.
"'In time of peace prepare for war.'"</p>

<p>"But how do they prepare for war, Papa?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"By having sham fights: going through the
motions in a way to do harm to no one; firing
what we call blank cartridges,&mdash;powder but no
balls; getting the men so familiar with their guns
that they can handle them rapidly and without
making mistakes even in the dark. Ah, see!
there it comes!" as at that instant a signal-light
from the flag-ship shot up several hundred feet
into the air, speedily followed by another and
another, till the whole sky seemed bright with
them; while Captain Raymond, the only one on
the yacht who understood the messages, read
them off to the others and called their attention
to the movements of the ships in prompt obedience
to the orders.</p>

<p>"What is that they're doing, Papa?" asked
Grace, presently.</p>

<p>"Arranging themselves in different orders of
battle," he replied, and proceeded to explain each
movement as it was made.</p>

<p>"It's ever so nice to see them," she said,
"though I do hope they won't ever have to do
any real fighting."</p>

<p>"I hope not, indeed," her father said; "but in
this wicked, quarrelsome world the only way to
secure peace is to show that we are ready for
self-defence in case of attack."</p>

<p>"How beautifully and promptly every signal
is obeyed!" remarked Grandma Elsie. "It is a
sight worth coming a long distance to see."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, Mamma," said Violet; "and I'm proud
of our navy, even though it is so inferior in size
to that of England."</p>

<p>"Inferior in size, but in nothing else, I believe,
Mamma Vi," said Max, speaking with some
excitement. "You know we've whipped the
British twice on the sea in spite of their navy
being so very much larger than ours."</p>

<p>"Yes, Maxie, I believe I'm as proud of that
fact as even you can be," laughed Violet, while
his father gave him a look of mingled amusement
and pride.</p>

<p>"I think," remarked Edward Travilla, "that
from the beginning of our national life our navy
has been one to be proud of."</p>

<p>"In which I entirely agree with you," said the
Captain. "But the exhibition seems to be over
for to-night, and the hour is a late one to find
our young people out of bed."</p>

<p>"Must we go now, Papa?" Lulu asked in a
coaxing tone which seemed to add, "I hope you
will let us stay at least a little longer."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "my little girls may say
good-night now and go at once."</p>

<p>They obeyed promptly and cheerfully, and
before long the others followed their example,
till Mr. Keith and the Captain had the deck to
themselves.</p>

<p>They lingered there for quite a long while,
seeming to have fallen upon some very interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>topic of conversation; but it was suddenly
broken in upon by the sound of the
flag-ship's drum, instantly followed by those of
all the other vessels of the squadron.</p>

<p>"Ah, what is the meaning of that, Raymond?"
asked Keith, gazing toward the war-ships with
keen interest and excitement. "It sounds to me
like a call to battle."</p>

<p>"So it is," replied the Captain,&mdash;"a night exercise
at the great guns, training the men so that
they may be ready for all the surprises of a time
of war."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke his passengers came hurrying
from the cabin, the ladies and young girls wrapped
in dressing-gowns and shawls, hastily thrown on
to conceal their night-dresses, one and another
asking excitedly what was going to be done now.
But even as the words left their lips the thunder
of cannon burst upon their ears, drowning
the Captain's voice when he would have replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it war, brother Levis, <em>really</em> war?"
queried little Walter, in great excitement.</p>

<p>"No, my boy; only a playing at war, I am
thankful to be able to say. You may look and
listen without fear that any one is to be killed, or
even wounded, unless through carelessness."</p>

<p>But the cannon were thundering again, ship
after ship firing off whole broadsides at some
imaginary foe. At length, however, it was all
over, and the passengers of the "Dolphin" returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>to their berths to stay there for the remainder
of the night.</p>

<p>"Why, we are anchored, are we not, Levis?"
Violet asked of her husband on awakening the
next morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," he answered; "we are riding
at anchor in Gardiner's Bay. I suspected that
would prove the destination of the squadron, it
being about the best place for naval exercises in
our Northern waters; and it seems I was right.
The squadron is at anchor now at no great distance
from us."</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose they will do here?"</p>

<p>"Probably fight some sham battles on sea and
land. Do you care to witness such?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much! I should greatly prefer
witnessing a sham battle to a real one. But
they won't be likely to begin it immediately, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; I presume we shall have time for a
hearty breakfast first," replied her husband, with
a slight look of amusement. "Don't allow the
prospect of witnessing a battle to spoil your appetite
for your morning meal, little wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered, with a pleasant laugh.
"I really am not now so much of a child as all
that would come to."</p>

<p>It was not long before she and nearly every
other passenger had sought the deck to take a
look at their surroundings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>They found Gardiner's Bay a beautiful body of
water bounded by islands on nearly every side,
that forming its eastern shore bearing the same
name. There were a large number of vessels in
the bay,&mdash;several sloops, schooners, and a yacht
or two beside the "Dolphin," to say nothing of
the squadron of war-ships. But all were lying
quietly at anchor, and our friends willingly responded
to the call to breakfast.</p>

<p>Yet no one cared to linger at the table; and
when all had finished their repast they quickly
repaired to the deck to watch the movements of
the squadron. But for a while there seemed to
be none, the vessels all riding quietly at anchor.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Rosie at length exclaimed, "I
wish they'd begin to do something!"</p>

<p>"I think they are going to," said Max. "See,
there's a boat leaving the flag-ship; I suppose to
carry a message to one of the others."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go and ask Papa about it!" exclaimed
Lulu.</p>

<p>"About what, daughter?" asked the Captain's
voice close at her side.</p>

<p>"That boat that has just left the flag-ship,
sir," she answered. "Do you know where it's
going, and what for?"</p>

<p>"I can only conjecture that it carries some
message, probably from the Admiral to the commander
of one of the other vessels."</p>

<p>"It's pulling for the 'Wanita,'" said Max;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"and see, there are other boats going about
from one vessel to another."</p>

<p>"Yes," his father said, "and see yonder are
several boats filled with marines, pulling for the
shore of Gardiner's Island. Evidently there is
to be a sham fight."</p>

<p>"I'm ever so glad it won't be a real one,
Papa," said Grace. "It would be so dreadful
to see folks killed."</p>

<p>"It would indeed," he answered. "But you
may enjoy the show as much as you can, for
no one will be hurt unless by accident."</p>

<p>"All the ships seem to be getting boats ready
packed with things," remarked Lulu; "I wonder
what they are."</p>

<p>"Quite a variety," replied her father,&mdash;"great
guns, baggage, arms, provisions, and boxes that
doubtless contain materials and tools for repairs,
compasses, and other articles too numerous to
mention. There! the vessels are signalling that
they are ready."</p>

<p>"They are getting into the boats!" exclaimed
Max, clapping his hands in delight; "and the
other fellows that went first to the island seem to
be waiting and all ready to fight them."</p>

<p>Every one on the "Dolphin" was now watching
the embarkation with interest, the children in a
good deal of excitement; it was like a grand
show to them.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a beautiful sight!" said Eva. "How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>bright their guns and bayonets are, with the sun
shining on them! And there are the beautiful
stars and stripes flying from every boat. But
they are all in now,&mdash;at least I should think so;
the boats look full,&mdash;and why don't they start?"</p>

<p>"They are waiting for the Admiral's inspection
and order," replied Captain Raymond. "Ah,
see, there he is on the bridge of the flag-ship, with
his field-glass, looking them over. And now the
signal is given for them to proceed."</p>

<p>The boats moved off at once in the direction of
the island where the marines had preceded them.
Captain Raymond's explanations making all their
movements well understood by the young people
around him, who thought they had never witnessed
so fine a sight as the mimic fight that
presently ensued, opened by the marines firing a
volley of blank cartridges from the shore, which
was immediately replied to by the approaching
boats with musketry, howitzers, and Gatling guns.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the shore and landed, the
marines meanwhile pouring forth an unceasing
fire from behind their breastworks.</p>

<p>A fierce battle followed; there were charges
and counter-charges, advances and retreats, men
falling as if wounded or killed, and being carried
off the field by the stretcher-men.</p>

<p>That last-mentioned sight brought the tears to
Gracie's blue eyes, and she asked in tremulous
tones, "Are they really hurt or killed, Papa?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, darling," he said, pressing the small hand
she had put into his, "it is all pretence, just to
teach them what to do in case of actual war."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope that won't ever come!" she exclaimed,
furtively wiping away a tear. "Do you
think it will, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," he said; "but it would be the
height of folly not to prepare for such a contingency."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Max, throwing up his cap,
"our side's whipped and the other fellows are
retreating!"</p>

<p>"Which do you call our side? And do you
mean it <em>is</em> whipped, or <em>has</em> whipped?" asked
Rosie, with a laughing glance at the boy's excited
face.</p>

<p>But the Captain was speaking again, and Max
was too busy listening to him to bestow any
notice upon Rosie's questions.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Captain said, "the marines are
retreating; the battle is about over. Our side,
as Max calls it, you see, is throwing out advance-guards,
rear-guards, and flankers."</p>

<p>"What for, brother Levis?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"To make sure that they have taken the island."</p>

<p>"And what will come next, Captain?" asked
Grandma Elsie, who was watching the movements
of the troops with as much interest as
the children.</p>

<p>"Fortification, doubtless," he replied. "Ah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>yes; they are already beginning that work. They
must fortify the island in order to be able to hold
it."</p>

<p>"How, Papa?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"By throwing up breastworks, digging rifle-pits,
planting guns, and so forth. If you watch
closely, you will see what they do."</p>

<p>The children&mdash;to say nothing of the older
ones&mdash;watched closely and with keen interest
all the movements of the troops until interrupted
by the call to dinner.</p>

<p>They had scarcely returned to their post of
observation on the deck, having had barely time
to notice the completed fortifications, the tents
pitched, and the troops at their midday meal,
when a tiny strip of bunting was seen fluttering
at the flag-ship's main.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond was the first to notice it.
"Ah!" he said, "the fun on the island is over,&mdash;at
least for the present,&mdash;for there is the
Admiral's signal of recall."</p>

<p>"I'll bet the fellows are sorry to see it!" exclaimed
Max; "for I dare say they were going to
have some fun there on the island they've taken."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>Things were rather quiet for the rest of the
day, much to Max's disgust, though at his
father's bidding he tried to forget the
disappointment in study.</p>

<p>Toward evening Captain Raymond learned
something of the Admiral's plans. Two of the
vessels were to take possession of a part of the
bay set off as a harbour, the others to blockade
the entrance.</p>

<p>In reporting the matter to his passengers,
"Now," he said, "the preparations will take
them two or three days, and the question is, shall
we stay to see it all, or turn about and seek entertainment
elsewhere? Let us have the opinion of
all the older people, beginning with Grandpa
Dinsmore," looking pleasantly at the old gentleman
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"My preference would be rather for going
at once," replied Mr. Dinsmore; "yet I am entirely
willing to have the matter decided by your
younger people. I shall be quite content to
stay on if it seems desirable to the rest of the
company."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>The vote of the ladies and gentlemen was then
taken, when it appeared that the majority were
in favour of immediate departure; and the children,
though at first disappointed, grew quite
reconciled when a little time had been spent in
considering what might be seen and done in
other quarters.</p>

<p>"I think, Ned," Zoe said to her husband,
"that we would better go back to our cottage,
because Laurie and Lily are growing fretful,&mdash;tired
of the sea, I think."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, we will do so if you
wish it," was the good-natured reply. "Strange
as it may seem, I too am quite desirous to make
our twin babies as comfortable as possible," he
added, with a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you should miss the sight of further
operations here, Cousin Donald," remarked
Grandma Elsie, turning to her kinsman.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Cousin Elsie," he replied; "but
though that would be an interesting sight to me,
I expect to find almost if not equal enjoyment in
a run out to sea or along shore with my friend
Raymond in command of the vessel."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think that'll be just splendid," exclaimed
Max, "and that before we get back,
Cousin Donald, you'll be ready to own up that
the navy is a more desirable place to be in than
the army."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wouldn't own up even if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>thought so," remarked Rosie, with a merry look
at her cousin; "I don't believe I should if I
were in his place."</p>

<p>"Possibly I might," he returned, laughingly,
"but I certainly do not expect to fall quite so
deeply in love with a 'life on the ocean wave,'
though I hope to be always willing and anxious
to serve my country wherever and whenever I
may be needed. I think both army and navy
always have been, and always will be, ready to
defend her on land or sea."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I believe that's so," said Max.
"And if ever we should have another war, I
hope I'll be able to help defend her."</p>

<p>"I hope so, my boy," the Captain said, regarding
the lad with an expression of fatherly
pride and affection.</p>

<p>An hour later the "Dolphin" was sailing
out of the bay, all her passengers gathered on
deck, taking a farewell look at the vessels belonging
to the squadron, and on awaking in the
morning they found themselves lying at anchor
in Newport harbour.</p>

<p>They returned to their cottages for a day or
two; then the Raymonds, Grandma Elsie, with
the youngest two of her children, and Donald
Keith, again set sail in the "Dolphin."</p>

<p>The weather was all that could be desired,
every one well and in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>Max was required to devote a part of each day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>to study, and recitation to his father, but did not
grumble over that, and took great delight in the
lessons in practical navigation given him daily
by the Captain.</p>

<p>"Papa," he asked one day, "what's the need
of a boy going to the Naval Academy when he
can learn everything he needs to know on shipboard
with a father like you?"</p>

<p>"But he can't," replied the Captain; "how
to sail a ship is by no means all he needs to know
to fit him to be an officer in the navy."</p>

<p>"Why, what else is necessary, sir?" asked
Max, with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>"A number of things which you saw done at
Newport and at Gardiner's Bay are quite necessary.
He must know how to fight a battle, take
charge of an ordnance foundry, and conduct an
astronomical observatory; must have a good
knowledge of history, be an able jurist and linguist,
and a good historian,&mdash;besides knowing
how to manage a ship in calm or storm."</p>

<p>"Whew! what a lot of things to cram into
one head!" laughed Max, with a slightly troubled
look on his bright young face.</p>

<p>"Isn't yours big enough to hold it all?"
asked his father, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"I dare say it is, sir," replied Max, "but the
difficulty is to pack it all in right. I presume the
teachers will help me to do that, though."</p>

<p>"Certainly; and if you follow their directions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>carefully you will have no need to fear
failure."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. That's very encouraging,"
said Max; "and I am fully determined to try
my very best, Papa, if it was only not to disgrace
my father."</p>

<p>"My dear son," the Captain said, a trifle
huskily, and taking the boy's hand in a warm
clasp, "I don't doubt that you intend to do
as you have said; but never forget that your
only safety is in keeping close to Him who
has said, 'In Me is thine help.'"</p>

<p>It was Saturday evening,&mdash;the first that had
found them on the broad ocean, out of sight of
land. They were all on deck, enjoying the delicious
evening breeze and a most brilliant sunset.</p>

<p>"Papa," Gracie said, breaking a momentary
silence, "what are we going to do about keeping
the Lord's Day to-morrow? We can't go to
church, you know, unless you can sail the 'Dolphin'
back to land in the night."</p>

<p>"I cannot do that, daughter," he answered;
"but I can conduct a service here on the deck.
How will that do, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Papa," she replied, with some
hesitation, blushing and looking fearful of hurting
his feelings; "I s'pose you couldn't preach
a sermon?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, smiling a little at her
evident embarrassment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>"Because you're not a minister, Papa."</p>

<p>"Why, Gracie! Papa's as good as any minister,
I'm sure," exclaimed Lulu, half reproachfully,
half indignantly.</p>

<p>"Of course he is; I didn't mean that!"
returned Gracie, just ready to burst into tears;
"I didn't mean he wasn't as good as anybody in
this whole world,&mdash;for of course he is,&mdash;but I
thought it was only ministers that preach."</p>

<p>"But I can read a sermon, my pet," the Captain
said, "or preach one if I choose; there is
no law against it. And we can pray and sing
hymns together; and if we put our hearts into
it all, our heavenly Father will be as ready to
listen to us as to other worshippers in the finest
churches on the land."</p>

<p>"That is a very comforting truth," remarked
Grandma Elsie; "it is very sweet to reflect that
God is as near to us out on the wide and deep
sea as to any of his worshippers on the dry
land."</p>

<p>"You will hold your service in the morning, I
suppose, Captain?" Mr. Keith said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"That is what I had thought of doing, sir,"
was the reply. "Have you any suggestions to
make?"</p>

<p>"Only that we might have a Bible class later
in the day."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that was a part of my programme,&mdash;at
least I had thought of teaching my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>children, as is customary with me at home; but
if the suggestion meets with favour, we will resolve
ourselves into a Bible class, each one able
to read taking part. What do you all say to the
proposition?"</p>

<p>"I highly approve," said Grandma Elsie; "I
am sure the day could not be better spent than
in the study of God's Holy Word."</p>

<p>"Nor more delightfully," said Violet.</p>

<p>"I think we would all like it, Captain," Evelyn
remarked in her quiet way.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall," said Lulu; "Papa always
makes Bible lessons very interesting."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Max; "I was never taught
by any minister or Sunday-school teacher that
made them half so interesting."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible that your near relationship
to your teacher may have made a good deal
of difference, my children," the Captain said
gravely, though not unkindly. "But who shall
act as teacher on this occasion is a question still
to be decided. I propose Grandma Elsie, as the
eldest of those present, and probably the best
qualified."</p>

<p>"All in favour of that motion please say ay,"
added Violet, playfully. "I am sure no better
teacher could be found than Mamma, though I
incline to the opinion that my husband would
do equally well."</p>

<p>"Much better, I think," Grandma Elsie said;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"and I would greatly prefer to be one of his
pupils."</p>

<p>"I can hardly consider myself wise enough to
teach my mother," said the Captain, colouring
and laughing lightly, "even though she is far too
young to be own mother to a man of my age."</p>

<p>"But you may lead a Bible class of which she
forms a part, may you not?" queried Donald
Keith.</p>

<p>"I suppose that might be possible," the Captain
replied, with a humourous look and smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you can and will, since such is
your mother's wish," Grandma Elsie said in a
sportive tone, "and so we may consider that
matter settled."</p>

<p>"And Mamma's word having always been law
to her children, we will consider it so," Violet
said. "Shall we not, Levis?"</p>

<p>"As good and dutiful children I suppose we
must, my dear," he returned in the playful tone
she particularly liked.</p>

<p>Sunday morning dawned clear and beautiful, a
delicious breeze filling the sails and wafting the
vessel swiftly onward over the sparkling water.</p>

<p>An hour or so after breakfast, captain, passengers,
and crew, except the man at the helm,
gathered on deck, every one in neat and appropriate
dress. The ladies, gentlemen, and children
sat on one side, the crew on the other, Captain
Raymond standing between. A Bible and a pile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>of hymn-books lay on a stand before him, and
Max was directed to distribute the latter. They
were a part of the supplies Captain Raymond
had laid in for the voyage.</p>

<p>A melodeon also stood near the stand, and
Violet, seating herself before it, led the singing
with which the service opened.</p>

<p>The Captain then offered a short prayer, read a
portion of Scripture, a second hymn was sung;
then he gave them a short discourse on the text,
"They hated Me without a cause."</p>

<p>With much feeling and in simple language that
the youngest and most ignorant of his hearers
could readily understand, he described the lovely
character and beneficent life of Christ upon
earth,&mdash;always about His Father's business,
doing good to the souls and bodies of men,&mdash;and
the bitter enmity of the scribes and Pharisees,
who "hated Him without a cause." Then
he went on to tell of the agony in the garden, the
betrayal by Judas,&mdash;"one of the twelve,"&mdash;the
mockery of a trial, the scourging and the crown
of thorns, the carrying of the cross and the
dreadful death upon it.</p>

<p>"All this He bore for you and for me," he concluded
in tones tremulous with emotion; "constrained
by His great love for us, He died that
dreadful death that we might live. And shall
we not love Him in return? Shall we not give
ourselves to Him, and serve Him with all our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>powers? It is a reasonable service, a glad service,&mdash;a
service that gives rest to the soul. He
says to each one of us, 'Take My yoke upon
you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly
in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.'</p>

<p>"Ah, do not refuse or neglect His invitation,
for the only choice is between His service and
that of Satan,&mdash;that malignant spirit whose
fierce desire and effort is to drag all souls down
to his own depths of sin and misery; and Jesus
only can save you from falling into his cruel
hands. But He&mdash;the Lord of Life and Glory&mdash;invites
us all to come and be saved, and
'now is the accepted time; now is the day of
salvation.' Delay is most dangerous; life is
very uncertain. We are sure of no time but
now."</p>

<p>He closed the Bible and sat down; and Violet,
again seating herself before the melodeon, softly
touched the keys and sang in sweet, low tones,
but so distinctly that every word reached the
farthest listener,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come to Jesus, come to Jesus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to Jesus just now, just now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to Jesus, come to Jesus just now."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then, at a sign from the Captain, Mr. Keith
followed with an earnest prayer; and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>another hymn in which all united, the services
closed.</p>

<p>Among the crew was one young man in whom
the Captain and Grandma Elsie had both come
to feel a peculiar interest. He was evidently an
American, and possessed of more intelligence
and education than the average sailor before
the mast. He had listened with close attention
to the Captain's discourse, and with a
troubled countenance, as Mrs. Travilla had
noticed.</p>

<p>"The Holy Spirit is striving with him, I have
little doubt," she said to herself. "Ah, if I
could but help him to find Jesus, and to know
the sweetness of His love!"</p>

<p>It was not long before the desired opportunity
offered. The young man was at the wheel and
no one near, while she paced the deck slowly
and alone. Gradually she approached, and
when close at his side made some pleasant
remark about the vessel and the course they
were steering.</p>

<p>He responded in a polite and respectful
manner.</p>

<p>Then she spoke of the service of the morning,
said she had noticed the attention he paid
to the Captain's short sermon, and asked in
kindest words and tones if he, like herself,
was one who loved Jesus, and trusted in Him
for salvation from sin and eternal death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>He sighed deeply, then said with emotion,
"No, madam, but&mdash;I wish I were."</p>

<p>"But what is to hinder, my friend, since He
says, 'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
cast out'?" she asked gently, feelingly.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, evidently from
emotion, then said, rather as if thinking aloud
than addressing her, "If I only knew just
how!"</p>

<p>"He is very near, and His omniscient eye
reads the heart," she said low and feelingly.
"Speak to Him just as if you could see Him,&mdash;as
if you were kneeling at His feet,&mdash;and He
will hear.</p>

<p>"The Bible says. 'If we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' Do you
want that cleansing, my friend?"</p>

<p>He bowed a silent assent.</p>

<p>"Then go to Jesus for it," she said. "He, and
He alone, can give it. He shed His blood for us
that 'God may be just and the justifier of him
that believeth in Jesus;' for 'the blood of Jesus
Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.'"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then, "I'd
like to be a Christian, ma'am," he said, "such
as I see you and the Captain are, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was left unfinished; and after a
moment's pause. "I should like you to be a better
one than I am," she said, "but Jesus only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>can make you such. The work is too difficult for
any human creature; but Jesus is all-powerful,&mdash;'able
to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make
intercession for them.' Is not that a precious
assurance?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed, ma'am, if&mdash;if I only knew it
meant me."</p>

<p>"You certainly will be one of those of whom it
speaks if you 'come unto God by Him;' and He
invites you to come: 'Come unto Me all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.'"</p>

<p>"Could you tell me just how, ma'am,&mdash;as
if you were pointing out the right road to a traveller,
for instance?"</p>

<p>"I will try," she said. "You must remember
that He is always near,&mdash;close to us, though we
cannot see Him; and you may speak to Him
as readily, and with as much assurance that you
will be heard, as you have been speaking to me.</p>

<p>"He is full of love and compassion,&mdash;love so
infinite, compassion so great that He was willing
to endure all the agony of death upon the
cross, and the far greater suffering caused by the
burden of the sins of the world and the consequent
hiding of His Father's face; therefore
He will not cast you out, will not turn away from
you, if you come in true penitence and faith.</p>

<p>"Make confession of your sins and plead for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>pardon and acceptance as you would if you could
see Him while kneeling at His feet; and He will
grant it, will forgive all your transgressions and
adopt you into His family to be His own child
forever."</p>

<p>But others of the passengers were now drawing
near, and he had only time to thank her for
her kindly interest in him, and promise to think
of what she had been saying, before Walter and
Max were at her side, calling her attention to a
passing vessel.</p>

<p>A very interesting Bible lesson filled up most
of the afternoon, both adults and children taking
part; and in the evening hymns were sung and
conversation held such as was suited to the
sacredness of the day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>A few days longer the "Dolphin" kept on her
eastward course, then was headed for the shore
of Massachusetts, bound for Boston, where Mr.
Keith must leave her, his furlough having now
nearly expired. He and his cousins would be
sorry to part; but there was no help for it, as
Uncle Sam's orders must be obeyed.</p>

<p>The young folks of the party had particularly
enjoyed the little trip out to sea, but expected to
find a sail along the coast of the New England
States quite as much to their taste, particularly
as it would give them an opportunity to look
upon some of the scenes of incidents in the two
wars with England.</p>

<p>They had come in sight of the coast and were
all gathered upon the deck.</p>

<p>"That is Scituate, is it not, Captain?" asked
Grandma Elsie, indicating a town that had just
come into view.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "and I presume you remember
the story of the last war with England, connected
with it?"</p>

<p>"I do," she answered; "but I presume it
would be new to some at least of these young
people."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>Then entreaties for the story poured in upon
her and the Captain from both boys and girls.</p>

<p>"It is but a short one; and I would prefer
to have the Captain tell it," Mrs. Travilla
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, please do!" exclaimed Lulu; and
he complied.</p>

<p>"It was, as I have said, during the last war
with England that the occurrence I am about to
tell of took place. At that time there was a
light-house in the harbour kept by a man named
Reuben Bates, who had a family of grown-up
sons and daughters.</p>

<p>"He and his sons were members of a militia
company of the town, and one day during the
war they were all absent from home on that
business, leaving the light-house in charge of
the daughters, Abigail and Rebecca.</p>

<p>"The girls, who were no doubt keeping a
vigilant watch for the approach of the enemy,
saw a British ship entering the harbour, and
conjectured that it was the design of those on
board of her to destroy the fishing-boats in the
harbour and perhaps burn the town, or at least
rob its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"They must have been brave girls, for at once
they began to consider what they could do to
drive away the would-be invaders.</p>

<p>"I presume Abigail exclaimed, 'Oh, if we
could only make them think there were troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ready to defend the town, and so frighten them
away!' And very likely Rebecca replied, 'Perhaps
we can. If you can play the fife, I'll beat
the drum; and if we are hidden from sight they
may think there are troops ready to receive
them if they come ashore, and so be afraid to
land.'</p>

<p>"So they went around behind some sand-hills
and played 'Yankee Doodle' in a lively way
that had exactly the desired effect.</p>

<p>"The British ship had sent out boats filled
with armed men who were pulling for the shore;
but on hearing the music of the drum and fife,
they evidently concluded that there might be a
large force of American soldiers ready to receive
them, and thinking 'discretion the better part of
valour,' turned about and pulled back to their ship
again without attempting to land."</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't that good?" exclaimed Lulu;
"I think the fathers and brothers of those girls
must have been proud of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say they were," said Max.</p>

<p>"I wonder what became of them&mdash;those
girls&mdash;afterward?" said Rosie. "Of course
they must have been dead and gone long before
this."</p>

<p>"No," replied the Captain, "Abigail died only
recently at the advanced age of eighty-nine."</p>

<p>"Papa, won't you stay awhile in Boston and
take us to see some of the places connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>with Revolutionary times,&mdash;Bunker Hill and its
monument, and maybe some others?" asked
Max.</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased to do so, my son, if nothing
happens to prevent," was the pleasant-toned
reply. "It is my strong desire to have my
children well-informed in regard to the history
of their own country."</p>

<p>"And ardent patriots too, Papa, ready to defend
her to the utmost of their ability should she
be attacked by any other power?" queried Max,
looking smilingly up into his father's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son; particularly the boys," replied
the Captain, smiling in his turn at the lad's
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one of your girls that I am
sure would find a way to help, Papa,&mdash;nursing the
wounded soldiers perhaps, or carrying despatches
or something," said Lulu; "perhaps giving information
of an intended attack by the enemy,
as Lydia Darrah did."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you would do all you could,
daughter, and might perhaps be of more assistance
than many a man," her father answered
kindly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shouldn't be brave enough to
do such things as that," remarked Grace, with a
look that seemed to say she felt herself quite
inferior to her braver sister; "but I could pray
for my country, and I know that God hears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>and answers prayer,&mdash;so that would be helping,
wouldn't it, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear child; the Bible tells us a great
deal about the power of prayer; 'Call upon Me
in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify Me,' is one of its promises."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandma Elsie, "a cry to God,
the Ruler of the universe, for help, may accomplish
more than any effort on the part of man
to do for himself."</p>

<p>"But people must help themselves too,
Mamma?" Walter said, half in assertion, half
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, if they can; 'Faith without
works is dead,' the Apostle says. The right way
is to do all we can to help ourselves, at the
same time asking God's blessing upon our
efforts."</p>

<p>"As General Washington did," remarked
Mr. Keith. "He was a man of both works
and prayer,&mdash;a blessing to his country, and to
the world; in my estimation the greatest mere
man that ever lived. 'First in peace, first in
war, first in the hearts of his countrymen.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Grandma Elsie, "I like the
toast given by some one,&mdash;I have forgotten who
it was,&mdash;'Washington: Providence left him
childless that his country might call him father.'
He seems to me to have been as nearly perfect as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>one of the sinful race of man could be!"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Captain Raymond; "thoroughly
unselfish, just, generous, modest, self-denying
and self-sacrificing, charitable to the poor,
forgiving, fearless and heroic; a God-fearing man
who sought nothing for himself, but was ready to
do or die for his country; true to her, to his friends,
to his God; a sincere and earnest Christian,&mdash;where
can a more noble character be found?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Travilla, "he was an
instrument raised up and prepared of God for
the work that he did in securing to our beloved
country the liberties she now enjoys."</p>

<p>"I very much like what Lord Brougham says
of him," remarked Violet.</p>

<p>"Oh, can you repeat it, Mamma Vi?" queried
Lulu, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I can," returned Violet, who
was blessed with an excellent memory.</p>

<p>"'It will be the duty of the historian and sage
in all ages to let no occasion pass of commemorating
this illustrious man; and until time
shall be no more, will a test of the progress
which our race has made in wisdom and virtue
be derived from the veneration paid to the immortal
name of Washington!'"</p>

<p>"I like that," said Rosie, her eyes sparkling
with pleasure and enthusiasm, "and it's none the
worse for having come from an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," assented Keith.</p>

<p>"Mamma, was Washington commander at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>the battle of Bunker Hill?" asked Walter.
"I ought to know; but I can't remember just
now."</p>

<p>"No, my son," she answered, "it was fought
before he reached Boston,&mdash;in fact, the very
day, June 17, that Congress agreed to his commission
as commander-in-chief of all the Continental
forces raised, or to be raised; and on the
21st he set out on horseback from Philadelphia
for Boston to take command of the American
army encamped there,&mdash;or rather around it, the
British being in possession of the town itself.
News did not fly then as it does in these days,
by any means; and it was not till he arrived in
New York, on the 25th, that the tidings reached
him.</p>

<p>"The next day he was in the saddle again,
pushing on toward the scene of conflict. He
reached Cambridge on the 2d of July, and the
next day took command of the army, drawing
his sword under an ancient elm."</p>

<p>"Why, just think!" exclaimed Walter, "it
took him nearly two weeks to travel from Philadelphia
to Boston, while now we could do it in
less than two days. No wonder it took so long
to fight the British and drive them out of our
country!"</p>

<p>"I think we'd do it in less than half that time
now," said Max. "We could move so much
faster, besides raising a great deal bigger army;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>to say nothing of the navy, that I believe has
done better in every one of our wars than the
land forces. I remember to have read that the
army Washington took command of then consisted
of only seventeen thousand men, only
fourteen thousand five hundred of them fit for
duty; that they were without needed supplies of
tents or clothing or as much as nine cartridges
to a man."</p>

<p>"Yes; it's a wonder Washington wasn't
completely discouraged," remarked Evelyn. "I
think he surely would have been if he had not
put his trust in God and the righteousness of
our country's cause."</p>

<p>"No doubt it was that which strengthened
him for the long and arduous struggle," said
Mrs. Travilla. "Washington was, as I said a
moment since, a man of prayer; he looked to
God for help in the hour of his country's sorest
need, and surely his prayers were heard and
answered."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma," said Rosie; "I remember
reading that he would go into the woods to pray
privately for his bleeding country and his suffering
soldiers; that some one happened to see him
alone there in prayer with the tears coursing
down his cheeks. Oh, it's no wonder that with
such a leader and in so righteous a cause, our
arms were victorious in spite of the fearful
odds against us!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>"And it was God who gave us such a
leader," responded her mother, "and gave
him wisdom and courage for his work, and
final success in carrying it on to the desired
end."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he a member of the Continental
Congress before his election as commander-in-chief
of the armies?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her mother. "So was Patrick
Henry; and he, when asked whom he considered
the greatest man in that body, replied, 'If you
speak of eloquence, Mr. Rutledge, of South Carolina,
is by far the greatest orator; but if you
speak of solid information and sound judgment,
Colonel Washington is unquestionably the
greatest man on that floor.'"</p>

<p>"How long did Washington stay there close
to Boston, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"He carried on the siege for eight months,
then on the 17th of March, 1776, succeeded in
driving the British away."</p>

<p>"Then did he take possession of the town and
stay there awhile?"</p>

<p>"He stayed until April, then went to New
York, reaching there on the 13th. Soon after
he went to Philadelphia to confer with Congress,
then back to New York.</p>

<p>"While he was there anxiously awaiting an
attack from the British, the Declaration of Independence,
just passed by Congress, was sent him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>The troops were quickly paraded, and the Declaration
read at the head of the army.</p>

<p>"In the orders of the day Washington said to
the troops, 'The General hopes that this important
event will serve as a fresh incentive to
every officer and soldier to act with fidelity and
courage, as knowing that the peace and safety
of his country depend, under God, solely on
the success of our arms.'</p>

<p>"But I cannot tell you now the whole story of
Washington's services to his country in the war
for independence, to say nothing of all that he
did for her afterward."</p>

<p>"I think we will read about it after we go
home to Woodburn," the Captain said.</p>

<p>"Frederick the Great was a great admirer of
Washington," remarked Mr. Keith. "He is said
to have pronounced Washington's masterly movements
on the Delaware the most brilliant achievements
recorded in military annals. And Lossing
tells us of a portrait of himself which Frederick
sent to Washington accompanied by the very
gratifying words, 'From the oldest general in
Europe to the greatest general in the world.'
As for myself, I must say that I think Washington's
success, in spite of all the difficulties and
discouragements he had to encounter, was something
most wonderful, and was given him in
answer to prayer, and because he put his trust in
God and looked to Him for wisdom and for help."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>"He was certainly one of the most unselfish
of men," remarked Violet. "What other man
would have refused with scorn and indignation,
as he did, the suggestion that his army would
like to make him a king?"</p>

<p>"Oh, did they want to make him king, and
tell him so?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't you know that?" returned
Lulu.</p>

<p>"Papa, won't you tell about it?" Grace asked,
turning to her father.</p>

<p>"I will, daughter," he answered in a kindly,
affectionate tone, and taking in his the hand she
had laid upon his knee.</p>

<p>"The battle of Yorktown, which practically
secured the independence of our country, was
fought in October, 1781, but the treaty of peace
was not signed till Jan. 20, 1783; so our
armies were not disbanded, and officers and
soldiers were sorely tried by their pay being
delayed, and feared, not without reason, that they
might be disbanded without Congress making
proper provision for meeting their just claims.</p>

<p>"Some of the officers began to doubt the efficiency
of the Government, and of all republican
institutions, and talked among themselves as to
whether it might not be better to establish a
monarchy instead; and at length one of them
was deputed to confer with Washington on the
subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>"He did so,&mdash;it seems in writing,&mdash;and even
ventured to suggest for him the title of king.</p>

<p>"But, as you have just heard, Washington
rebuked the writer severely, saying he was at a
loss to conceive what part of his conduct could
have given encouragement to an address that
seemed to him big with the greatest mischiefs
that could befall his country; that if he was
not deceived in the knowledge of himself, they
could not have found a person to whom their
schemes were more disagreeable.</p>

<p>"He also conjured the writer, if he had any
regard for his country, concern for himself or
posterity, or respect for him, to banish these
thoughts from his mind, and never communicate
a sentiment of such a nature from himself or
any one else."</p>

<p>"Did they give it up then, Papa?" Gracie
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing more was ever said about making
Washington king," he answered; "but the next
December they sent to Congress a memorial on
the subject of their pay. A resolution was
adopted by that body, but such as did not satisfy
the complainants. Then a meeting of officers
was arranged for; and anonymous addresses,
commonly known as the Newburg addresses,
were sent out to rouse the army to resentment.</p>

<p>"Washington insisted on attending the meeting,
and delivered an impressive address.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>"He had written down what he wished to say,
and after reading the first paragraph paused to
put on his spectacles, saying most touchingly, as
he did so, that he had grown gray in the service
of his country, and now found himself growing
blind.</p>

<p>"He then went on to read a most noble paper
which he had prepared for the occasion. In it
he acknowledged the just claims of the army
against the Government, and assured them that
they would not be disregarded; then he entreated
them 'to express their utmost horror and detestation
of the man who wishes, under any specious
pretences, to overturn the liberties of our country,
and who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates
of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in
blood.'</p>

<p>"Then, having finished his address, he retired
from the meeting; but resolutions were at once
offered by General Knox, seconded by General
Putnam and adopted by the meeting, agreeing
with all he had said and reciprocating his expressions
of esteem and affection. They were
relieved of their doubts and fears and restored
to their wonted love for their country."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nice, Papa!" exclaimed Gracie,
her cheeks flushing and her eyes shining. "How
good and great our Washington was! It seems
to me we would never have got free from Great
Britain if we hadn't had him to help."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes: it does seem very doubtful," her father
replied. "As Grandma Elsie has said, God
seems to have raised up and prepared him for
that very work."</p>

<p>"And how soon after that was the war really
over, Papa?"</p>

<p>"The treaty of peace was signed in Paris
on the 20th of January, 1783, as I remarked a
moment since; but as it took a long while in
those days for people and news to cross the
ocean, it was not till the 17th of the following
April that Washington received the proclamation
of Congress for the cessation of
hostilities. Then on the 19th&mdash;which, as you
may remember, was the eighth anniversary of
the battle of Lexington, the opening conflict of
the war&mdash;the cessation was proclaimed at the
head of every regiment."</p>

<p>"What joyful news it must have been to
the poor, weary soldiers!" said Violet. "I
trust their hearts were full of gratitude to God,
who had prospered the right in spite of the
fearful odds against those who were battling
for it."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned her husband; "and no heart
could have been more thankful than that of the
commander-in-chief, who said in the general orders,
'The chaplains of the several brigades will
render thanks to Almighty God for all His mercies,
particularly for His overruling the wrath of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>man to His own glory, and causing the rage of
war to cease among the nations.'"</p>

<p>"What a good, good Christian man Washington
was, Papa!" exclaimed Gracie.</p>

<p>"And yet he had enemies; and there are still
some among his own countrymen who are far
from appreciating him,&mdash;can even speak evil of
him. But even our Lord Jesus Christ had enemies
and detractors&mdash;bitter and implacable foes&mdash;among
his own countrymen; and 'the servant
is not greater than his Lord,'" was the Captain's
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa, I remember that Washington
had enemies,&mdash;Gates for one, and that infamous
Conway for another," said Max. "How glad I
was to read of the Continental Congress accepting
the resignation he offered in a fit of anger, so
that he had to leave the army for good, though
he didn't want to!"</p>

<p>"I think it was for good, Max," remarked
Mr. Keith, with a slightly amused smile,&mdash;"for
the good of the country, though perhaps not for
his own. Conway was a man America was well
rid of; and the same may be as truly said of
Charles Lee. What would have become of our
liberties had that infamous cabal succeeded in
getting the command taken from Washington and
given to any one of themselves!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>Evelyn Leland was the only one of the party
on the "Dolphin" who had never seen Boston;
but to all the young people entering the city
from the sea was a new experience, and as the
vessel neared the harbour they gazed about
them with great interest, while the Captain
pointed out and named the forts and the islands
as they came into view.</p>

<p>"Yonder is Boston Light," he said, "two
miles east of Fort Warren,&mdash;on George's Island,
which I will point out presently; it is a revolving
light, ninety-two feet above the level of the sea.
And yonder is Spit or Bug Light; it is only thirty-five
feet high, and stands upon iron pillars fixed
in the rock. They show a red fixed light there
which can be seen at the distance of seven miles.</p>

<p>"Then there is Long Island Light, named from
the island on which it stands. The tower is only
twenty-two feet above the ground, but eighty
feet above the sea.</p>

<p>"Yonder," again pointing with his finger, "is
Fort Independence (called in Revolutionary times
Castle William) just at the entrance of the main
channel; and opposite it is Fort Winthrop.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>And yonder is George's Island with its fortification,&mdash;Fort
Warren."</p>

<p>"And this was the harbour where the Boston
Tea-party was held!" remarked Evelyn, in a half-musing
tone. "What an exciting time that
must have been! I think it was grand in the
people to give up the tea they so enjoyed drinking,
rather than submit to 'taxation without
representation.'"</p>

<p>"Which all women possessed of landed property
do to this day," returned Rosie, mischievously.</p>

<p>Eva laughed. "Oh, well," she said, "you
know American women can influence the voters
to whom they are related,&mdash;their brothers, husbands,
and sons."</p>

<p>"If they have any, and they happen to be
particularly tractable," laughed Rosie. "But
how about poor fatherless and brotherless single
women? The men may vote as heavy taxes
upon their property as they please, while they
can't lift a finger to prevent it, or say a word
as to what is to be done with the money taken
from their purses without their consent."</p>

<p>"Why, Rosie, are you turning into a woman's
rights woman?" queried Max, laughing.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Maxie; those ideas just happened
to suggest themselves," she answered.
"I'll take time to think it all out one of these
days, though; and I'll not promise not to turn
into an advocate of women's right to have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>say about the taxing of their own property. I
see no reason why a man's rights in that direction
should be considered superior to a woman's."</p>

<p>"No; nor I either," Max said. "And I'm as
willing as possible that American women should
have all their rights; but I shouldn't like to let
ignorant women&mdash;foreign or coloured ones&mdash;vote."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the trouble," laughed Rosie; "I
shouldn't like that either. But I can't see that
it's any better to let foreign men who are too
ignorant to understand much or anything about
our institutions, have a vote. I must say it
strikes me as exceedingly insulting to educated,
intelligent ladies, who are native Americans, to
refuse a vote to <em>them</em>, and at the same time give
it to <em>such foreign-born men</em>, or to male natives
who know nothing, can't read or write, and have
no property at all."</p>

<p>"Coloured men, for instance?" queried Max.</p>

<p>"Yes, coloured or white; it's the education
I'm concerned about, not the colour. Mamma,
do not you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Mrs. Travilla answered. "I
have no desire to vote myself; but I think only
native-born citizens, or those who have been
twenty-one years in the country, should have a
vote, and not even they unless able to read and
write, capable of understanding our form of government,
and possessed of some little property,&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>last in order that they may appreciate more
fully the burdens of taxation, and be less ready
to make them heavier than need be."</p>

<p>"Papa," asked Gracie, "where abouts were
the tea ships when the folks went on board and
threw the tea into the water?"</p>

<p>"They were moored at Griffin's Wharf," he
replied; "I can point it out to you directly."</p>

<p>"What is it, Papa, Gracie's talking about?
A story?" queried little Elsie. "Please, Papa,
tell it to us."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you would hardly understand,
Papa's darling," the Captain said, stroking the
soft, shining, golden curls as he spoke, and
smiling down into the bright, eager little face.</p>

<p>"I think I should, Papa. Wasn't it something
'bout a tea-party?" she asked coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Papa, please do tell the story; we'd all
like to hear it over again now when we're just
at the place where it happened," added Gracie.</p>

<p>"Well, my darlings, to please you," he said;
"also because I want you to be thoroughly
grounded in the history of your own country.</p>

<p>"You must remember that these States,&mdash;or
rather the original thirteen, there were only so
many at that time,&mdash;were then called colonies,
and were ruled by England. The English Government
claimed the right to tax the colonies just
as they pleased. That right the people of the
colonies denied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>"They were not allowed to send any members
to Parliament to help decide who in America
should be taxed and how much; so they determined
that rather than pay a tax put upon the
article without their knowledge and consent,
they would do without tea.</p>

<p>"Then the English Government tried to force
it on them; and these ships came into their harbour
loaded with the tea, which they intended
to land.</p>

<p>"One of those tea-laden ships, called the
'Dartmouth,'&mdash;Captain Hall in command,&mdash;came
to anchor yonder, near the Castle, as it
was then called. It was on Sunday the 'Dartmouth'
came in; and as you may suppose,
the sight of her caused a great excitement in
Boston.</p>

<p>"Early on Monday morning a placard was
posted all over the town. I committed it to
memory when a school-boy. It said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'Friends! Brethren! Countrymen! That worst
of plagues, the detested tea shipped for this port by
the East India Company, is now arrived in the harbor;
the Hour of Destruction, or manly opposition to the
Machinations of Tyranny, stares you in the face;
every Friend to his Country, to himself, and to Posterity,
is now called upon to meet at Faneuil Hall, at
nine o'clock This Day (at which time the bells will ring),
to make united and successful resistance to this last,
worst, and most destructive measure of administration.'</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>"That was the handbill; its date was November
29, 1773."</p>

<p>"Was that the 'vite to the tea-party?" asked
little Elsie.</p>

<p>"Not to what proved to be the principal one,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"In response to the call they met that day at
Faneuil Hall, but the excitement was so great
and brought so many people together that they
adjourned to the Old South Meeting-house which
was larger.</p>

<p>"At that meeting it was resolved that the tea
should not be landed, that no duty should be paid
on it, and that it should be sent back in the same
vessel it had come in; also they notified the
owner and the commander of the vessel that
to land and enter the tea was at their own peril,
ordered the ship to be moored at Griffin's
Wharf, and appointed a guard of twenty-five
men to watch her.</p>

<p>"At the meeting a letter was received from
the consignees offering to store the tea till they
could hear from England; but the people were
determined not to allow it to be landed, so rejected
the offer with scorn.</p>

<p>"Then the sheriff read a proclamation from
the governor ordering them to disperse; but it
was received with hisses, and they went on with
the business that had called them together.</p>

<p>"They passed a resolution ordering the vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>of Captains Coffin and Bruce, which were hourly
expected to arrive with their loads of tea, to be
moored at Griffin's Wharf."</p>

<p>"Did they come, Papa? and did the men
watch all the ships that had tea?" asked Elsie,
who was listening with a look of interest and intelligence
that seemed to say she understood a
great deal, if not all her father had been
saying.</p>

<p>"Yes; and about two weeks afterward
another meeting was held in the Old South
Church, when it was resolved that Mr. Roch
must immediately apply for a clearance for his
ship and send her out to sea again. But the
governor had already taken measures to prevent
him from doing that, ordering Admiral
Montague to fit out two armed vessels and station
them at the entrance to the harbour, and Colonel
Leslie, who was in command of the Castle, not to
allow any vessel to pass out under the guns of
the fortress, unless she could show a permission
signed by himself."</p>

<p>"I should think," remarked Max, "that Mr.
Roch and Captain Hall must have been quite
puzzled to know how to act to suit all parties."</p>

<p>"What happened next, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"Two days later there was another meeting in
the Old South,&mdash;the largest meeting that had
then ever been known in Boston; for the people
were greatly excited.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>"Several persons made addresses, but Josiah
Quincy was the principal speaker. He advised
the people to weigh and consider before
they took measures that would bring on a trying
and terrible struggle such as had never been
seen in this country."</p>

<p>"Why, Papa," exclaimed Lulu, "I thought
Mr. Quincy was one of the patriots!"</p>

<p>"So he was, my child; but he wanted the
people to look before they leaped.</p>

<p>"When he had finished his speech the question
was put, 'Will you abide by your former resolutions
with respect to not suffering the tea to be
landed?'"</p>

<p>"And what did they say?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"That they would; the whole vast assembly
speaking as with one voice."</p>

<p>"I hope Mr. Roch was there to hear them,"
said Lulu.</p>

<p>"No," said her father. "The governor
was at his country-house, a few miles out of
Boston, and Mr. Roch had been sent to him
to ask a permit for his vessel to leave the
harbour.</p>

<p>"He returned late in the afternoon, before
the meeting at the Old South had broken up,
and reported to them that the governor refused
a permit until a clearance should be shown him;
and the collector refused that until the tea should
be landed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>"What a fuss about nothing!" exclaimed
little Elsie, with a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," her father said, stroking her hair
as she leaned upon his knee; "some day when
my little girl is older and wiser, she will understand
that it was very far from being about
nothing.</p>

<p>"The people were very much excited. It was
beginning to grow dark in the old church and
somebody called for candles; but just then
somebody in the gallery showed himself disguised
like a Mohawk Indian, raised the Indian
war-whoop, and was answered in the same fashion
by some one outside the building,&mdash;for the
throng a good deal more than filled the church;
then another voice in the gallery shouted,
'Boston harbour a teapot to-night! Hurrah for
Griffin's Wharf!'</p>

<p>"At that there was an instant motion to
adjourn, and the people crowded into the streets.</p>

<p>"It was a clear, moonlight evening, still quite
early, and the British squadron not more than a
mile away; British troops were near too, but
neither interfered with what was going on.</p>

<p>"It is probable that everything had been arranged
beforehand; and seeing several persons
disguised as Indians going toward Griffin's
Wharf, the people hurried thither. Some fifteen
or twenty were so disguised, but about sixty
boarded the vessels in the first place; and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>said that as many as a hundred and forty were
engaged in the work before it was finished.</p>

<p>"A man named Lendall Pitts acted as leader;
and under his direction the 'Dartmouth' was
boarded first, the hatches were taken up, and her
cargo of one hundred and fourteen chests of tea
brought on deck, where the boxes were broken
open and the tea was thrown into the water.</p>

<p>"Then the other two vessels were boarded
and their cargoes of tea also thrown into the
harbour."</p>

<p>"And that's what is called the 'Boston Tea
Party,'" remarked Max with satisfaction. "I'd
wish I'd been there to help, only that I'd rather
be here now."</p>

<p>"That's just the way I feel about it," said
Walter.</p>

<p>"You may be thankful, my dear boys, that
you live in these days," remarked Grandma
Elsie, smiling kindly upon them. "War times
are more interesting to tell about, but far harder
to live in. Our hearts may well be filled with
thankfulness to God for the success of our
fathers in securing the blessings of liberty for
not themselves only, but for us also. We assuredly
have more to be thankful for than any
other nation, and ought therefore to be better
and more earnest Christians, doing all we possibly
can to spread abroad through all the earth
the glad news of salvation by Christ, and to help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>the down-trodden and oppressed to share with
us the inestimable blessings of freedom,&mdash;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as our
Declaration of Independence has it."</p>

<p>But the "Dolphin" was fast approaching the
city, and there was so much to look at and talk
about, relating to the present, that for a time
the past was well-nigh forgotten, except when
the Captain pointed out as nearly as he could,
the precise spot where the never-to-be-forgotten
"tea party" had been held.</p>

<p>When he had done so, Max broke out into a
song to the tune of "Yankee Doodle," the other
young folks joining in with a will on the
chorus.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Once on a time old Johnny Bull flew in a raging fury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swore that Jonathan should have no trial, sir, by jury;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no elections should be held across the briny waters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now said he, 'I'll tax the Tea of all his sons and daughters.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down he sate in burly state, and blustered like a grandee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in derision made a tune called 'Yankee Doodle Dandy.'<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>A few days were spent in Boston, principally
in visiting places of historical interest,&mdash;Christ
Church on Salem Street, where as the Captain
told the children, Paul Revere's signal was
hung out from the steeple, in the Revolutionary
War, by Captain Pulling, a Boston merchant;
and the Old South Church, about which they had
already heard so much.</p>

<p>"In 1775," the Captain said, as the little
group stood gazing about it in deep interest,
"the British soldiers desecrated this place by
using it for cavalry drill, having first torn out
the galleries and covered the floor with earth.
It is now no longer used as a church, but, as you
see, is a historical museum. Now we will go to
Faneuil Hall,&mdash;'the cradle of liberty.'"</p>

<p>They did so; and next visited the Old State
House.</p>

<p>As the Captain told them, the Boston Massacre
occurred in the street before it; and there,
during the excitement in regard to the Stamp
Act, the stamped clearances were burned by the
mob. From the balcony the Declaration of Independence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>was read. Many town-meetings
were held there, and many patriotic speeches
made,&mdash;among them those of Otis, who foretold
probable war, and urged resistance to tyranny
"even unto blood" if necessary.</p>

<p>"Who was Otis, Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"A Boston lawyer of that time, a patriot,&mdash;as
evidenced by even the few words of his I have
just quoted. He was advocate-general with a
good salary at the time when the revenue officers
in Boston took out search-warrants to look for
smuggled goods, and called upon him to defend
their cause; but he at once resigned his office
and took the other side,&mdash;that of the merchants
of Boston, who were protesting against the writs.
They offered him a large fee, but he refused it,
saying, 'In such a cause I despise all fees.'"</p>

<p>"That case was tried in this old State House;
and Otis made a grand speech of such length that
it took him five hours to deliver it."</p>

<p>"What was it all about, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"It was on the question whether Americans
were bound to obey laws which they had no share
in making, and all the arguments in the wonderful
speech answered doggedly, 'No.'</p>

<p>"John Adams, who heard the speech, afterward
said that on that day 'the child Independence
was born;' and no doubt the argument
assisted the popular leaders very much in furnishing
them with weapons for their work."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>"Weapons, Papa?" Grace asked with a puzzled
look.</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter; arguments with which to
show the people what the English Government
was doing to take away our liberties.</p>

<p>"Otis afterward, when Governor Bernard
called upon the General Assembly of Massachusetts
to rescind the resolution it had passed
against the right of the English Parliament to
tax the colonies without their consent,&mdash;which
they boldly disregarded,&mdash;made a powerful
speech in which he said, 'When Lord Hillsborough
knows that we will not rescind <em>our</em> acts,
he should apply to Parliament to rescind <em>theirs</em>.
<em>Let Britons rescind their measures, or they are
lost forever!</em>' He went on speaking in that way
for nearly an hour, till even the Sons of Liberty
began to tremble lest he should go too far, and
be charged with treason."</p>

<p>"And did he fight for the country, Papa?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"No, poor fellow!" replied the Captain,
with a slight sigh; "before the war had fairly
begun he became insane from injuries inflicted
by one Robinson, a commissioner of customs,
who, with several army or navy officers set upon,
beat, and otherwise injured him, inflicting a
sword-cut on his head from which he never
recovered."</p>

<p>"And he didn't have the pleasure of seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>his country free and separated from England?"
Lulu said, half inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No; he was killed by a stroke of lightning
in 1778, which you will remember was several
years before the war was over."</p>

<p>Our little party next visited Lexington and
Concord.</p>

<p>"How far must we travel to get there,
Papa?" queried Gracie, as they took their
seats in the car.</p>

<p>"Only a few miles to Lexington, and a little
farther to reach Concord," he answered.</p>

<p>"That won't seem very far by rail," remarked
Max; "but it must have seemed quite a distance
to the soldiers who marched there in Revolutionary
times."</p>

<p>"I find we are early," the Captain said, looking
at his watch; "and as we have the car nearly
to ourselves, it may be well for us to talk over
what occurred in 1775 at the places we are about
to visit. I think it will make the visit more interesting
to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us the whole story, Papa,"
requested Gracie, with a look of pleased
anticipation.</p>

<p>The others all joined in her petition, and the
Captain good-naturedly complied.</p>

<p>"Matters had been growing worse and worse
between the British Government and the colonies,"
he said, "till a struggle seemed almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>inevitable. General Gage discovered that the
patriots were privately conveying arms out of
Boston, that some brass cannon and field-pieces
were at Salem; and on a Sunday in February,
1775, he sent some troops to seize them.</p>

<p>"An express from Marblehead arrived at Salem
while the people were in church, with the news that
British troops were landing from a transport at
that place, and were about to march to Salem.</p>

<p>"The congregations were at once dismissed,
and, led by Colonel Pickering, stopped the British
at a drawbridge. Pickering succeeded in
effecting a compromise, and the troops marched
back again to Marblehead without having done
the errand upon which they had been sent.</p>

<p>"Let me see," continued the Captain, meditatively;
"I think I can recall some lines by Trumbull,
referring to that incident:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Through Salem straight, without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold battalion took its way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marched o'er a bridge, in open sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of several Yankees arm'd for fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, without loss of time or men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veer'd round for Boston back again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found so well their prospects thrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every soul got back alive.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It was some two months after this that the
battles of Lexington and Concord took place.
On April 18, the patriots learned that the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>day British troops were to visit Concord for
the purpose of destroying some military stores
there, and passing through Lexington seize the
persons of John Hancock and Samuel Adams,
who were both in that town at the house of
the Rev. Jonas Clark.</p>

<p>"Gage had tried to keep all this a profound secret,
but somehow the patriots had learned what
he was attempting, and were making their preparations
accordingly. Warren and his friends
had gone, Paul Revere and William Dawes had
just rowed across the river to Charlestown, taking
a message from Warren to Adams and Hancock.
They were very near being captured by the
guard at Charlestown, but escaped, and reached
Lexington a little after midnight.</p>

<p>"They went at once to Mr. Clark's house, but
found a guard of eight minute-men placed about
it to protect Adams and Hancock.</p>

<p>"These refused to let Revere and Dawes into
the house, as orders had been given not to allow
the inmates to be disturbed by noise.</p>

<p>"'Noise!' exclaimed Revere, 'you'll have
noise enough before long; the regulars are
coming!'</p>

<p>"They were quickly admitted then, roused
Hancock and Adams, and knowing how unlikely
to escape being taken prisoners they were,
should they remain in Lexington, persuaded
them to retire to Woburn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then Revere and Dawes pushed on to Concord
to give the alarm there.</p>

<p>"By two o'clock in the morning a hundred and
thirty of the Lexington militia were collected at
the meeting-house upon the green. The roll was
called; then, as the early morning air was very
chilly, they were dismissed with orders to remain
within drum-beat."</p>

<p>"Papa, the British marched very quietly,
didn't they?" asked Max.</p>

<p>"Yes, in perfect silence; hoping and believing
that none of the Americans were aware of their
movements."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, how mistaken they were!" laughed
Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," his father said, "there were vigilant
eyes upon them. As they passed through West
Cambridge they were seen by Lee, Gerry, and
Orne,&mdash;members of the Provincial Congress,&mdash;and
as I have told you, others learned the secret
also.</p>

<p>"As the British neared Lexington their ears
were greeted by the sound of bells and guns,
warning them that their expedition was known."</p>

<p>"I s'pose they didn't like that," observed
Gracie, "but what did they do about it,
Papa?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Smith dispatched six companies
of troops under Major Pitcairn, with orders to
press on to Concord and secure the two bridges.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>He also sent a messenger to Boston for reinforcements.</p>

<p>"Pitcairn hastened on toward Lexington, capturing
several persons on his way. One of them&mdash;a
man named Bowman&mdash;escaped, hurried into
Lexington on horseback, and notified Captain
Parker, commander of the minute-men, that the
enemy was approaching."</p>

<p>"And did they make a great fuss and wake up
all the people, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"They rang the bells, fired guns, and beat the
drum, so that doubtless everybody was soon
aroused.</p>

<p>"It was between four and five in the morning.
About one hundred of the militia were quickly
collected on the green; but being raw troops, and
uncertain how large a force was coming against
them, they were in some confusion.</p>

<p>"And indeed it was an overwhelming force
they presently saw marching toward them, their
scarlet uniforms gleaming out through the early
morning mist.</p>

<p>"The British halted within a few rods of the
meeting-house and loaded their pieces. But the
Americans stood firm and undismayed.</p>

<p>"Their orders were not to pull a trigger till fired
upon by the enemy, and for a moment there was
silence and hesitation on both sides; neither
Americans nor British seemed willing to become
the aggressors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it was only for a moment; Pitcairn and
other officers galloped forward, waving their
swords over their heads, and followed by their
troops in double-quick time.</p>

<p>"'Disperse you villains!' they shouted, 'lay
down your arms and disperse. Why don't you
disperse, you rebels? Disperse!' And as the
patriots did not instantly obey the command,
Pitcairn wheeled his horse, waved his sword, and
gave orders to press forward and surround the
militia.</p>

<p>"At that instant some random shots were fired
by the British, and promptly returned by the
Americans."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, was anybody killed?" asked
Gracie.</p>

<p>"Not by those shots," replied her father;
"but the next minute Pitcairn drew a pistol
and discharged it, at the same time shouting
'Fire!'</p>

<p>"His troops instantly obeyed that order.
Four of the patriots were killed, and the rest
dispersed. They were fired upon again while
retreating, and several of them halted and returned
the shots, then concealed themselves behind
buildings and stone walls.</p>

<p>"Eight Americans were killed, three British
soldiers and Major Pitcairn's horse were
wounded."</p>

<p>"I thought you said only four Americans were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>shot, Papa," said Gracie, looking up inquiringly
into his face.</p>

<p>"Four by the first discharge of musketry,
and as many more while trying to escape over
the fences," he answered.</p>

<p>"Did the British care for having killed those
poor men?" she asked, tears of sympathy shining
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"If so they gave no evidence of it," her father
replied. "They hurried on to Concord in high
spirits. But the news of their approach had
been communicated, and a formidable body of
militia was waiting to receive them."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Rosie, "I remember that
Dawes and Revere had hurried on to warn them
after doing the Lexington people the same
service."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Captain said, "but on the way
they were taken prisoners by some British officers.
They had stopped to tell the news to Dr. Samuel
Prescott, who escaped over a wall, they being
captured. Prescott made his way to Concord,
reaching there about two o'clock in the morning,
and gave the alarm. Then the bells were
rung, and the people armed themselves, so that
before daylight they were ready to receive the
British."</p>

<p>"They knew what the British were after, and
made haste to conceal the stores of powder, shot,
and so forth,&mdash;didn't they, Papa?" asked Max.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; the whole male population and some
of the women assisted in that work, and succeeded
in concealing them in a safe place in the
woods before the arrival of the British."</p>

<p>"That was good," remarked Gracie. "And
didn't the British get anything at all, Papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. They knocked off the trunnions
of three iron twenty-four-pound cannon,
cut down a liberty-pole, set the Court House
on fire, and burned a few barrels of wooden
trenchers and spoons, and sixteen new carriage-wheels.
Also they threw five hundred pounds
of balls into a mill-pond, and broke open about
sixty barrels of flour; but the people succeeded
in saving a good deal of that, and Mrs. Moulton
put out the fire in the Court House before much
damage was done."</p>

<p>"But was there no fighting, Papa?" Gracie
asked.</p>

<p>"There was fighting," the Captain answered.
"While the British were at the mischief I have
been telling you of, the American party was
rapidly increasing by the coming in of minute-men
from the neighbouring towns. They formed
into line as fast as they came. There were
nearly four hundred of them.</p>

<p>"From the place where they were forming they
could see the fire the British had started in the
centre of the town, and of course the sight greatly
increased their excitement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>"Joseph Hosmer, the adjutant, made a stirring
appeal, after a brief consultation with prominent
citizens and members of the Committee of
Safety, who were present, and ready to take part
in repelling the British.</p>

<p>"It was agreed to dislodge them from the North
Bridge. Captain Davis saying, 'I haven't a
man that's afraid to go.'</p>

<p>"They wheeled into marching order, and
joined by other companies, pushed forward to
the bridge, under the command of Major John
Buttrick, of Concord.</p>

<p>"The British guard were on the west side of
the river, but crossed to the east on seeing the
Americans approaching, and began taking up
the planks of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Major Buttrick called to them to stop, and
urged his men on to try to save the bridge.</p>

<p>"The British formed for action as the Americans
drew near, and some of the regulars
fired, killing Captain Davis, Abner Hosmer, and
wounding another man.</p>

<p>"Then Buttrick shouted, 'Fire fellow soldiers!
for God's sake fire!' and instantly they gave
the British a full volley.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes the British retreated, and
the Americans took possession of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Their volley had killed three British soldiers,
two of whom were left on the ground. The
Americans afterward buried them, and we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>find their graves only a few feet from the
monument."</p>

<p>But other passengers had entered the car,
and the train was now in motion.</p>

<p>"There, that must do for the present," the
Captain said; "the story will have to be finished
after we leave the train."</p>

<p>Their first halt was at Lexington where they
viewed with much interest the ground where the
skirmish took place, the monument commemorating
the devotion of those who fell, and everything
to be found that had any connection with
the events which have made the place famous in
the annals of our country.</p>

<p>Evelyn Leland gazed long at the inscription
on the monument, then read aloud,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Sacred to the Liberty and the Rights of Mankind!!!
The Freedom and Independence of America&mdash;sealed
and defended with the blood of her sons&mdash;This
Monument is erected by the Inhabitants of Lexington ... to
the memory of their fellow citizens ... the
first victims of the sword of British Tyranny and
Oppression, on the morning of the ever-memorable
nineteenth of April, A. D. 1775. The Die was Cast!!!
The blood of these Martyrs in the Cause of God and
their Country was the Cement of the Union of these
States, then Colonies, and gave the Spring to the Spirit,
Firmness and Resolution of their Fellow citizens.
They rose as one man to revenge their Brethren's
blood and at the point of the sword to assert and defend
their native Rights. They nobly dared to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Free!!! The contest was long, bloody and affecting.
Righteous Heaven approved the Solemn Appeal;
Victory crowned their Arms, and the Peace, Liberty
and Independence of the United States of America
was their glorious Reward. Built in the year 1799."</p></div>

<p>"You didn't read it all, Eva," said Walter;
"you skipped the names."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "because I didn't want to
take time to read it all; though I'd be ever so
unwilling to rob the poor, dear, brave fellows of
any of the credit that belongs to them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>From Lexington our little party went on at
once to Concord. There they saw the monument,
and near it the graves of the two British
soldiers of whom the Captain had spoken as
having fallen in the fight.</p>

<p>"The British entered Concord in two divisions,"
he said; "one by the main road, the
other passing over the hill north of it. Captain
Beeman, of Petersham, and other Tories had
given them information in regard to the stores
secreted in Concord, and Captain Parsons with
six companies was sent to destroy them."</p>

<p>"Sent where, Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"To the house of Colonel Barrett," replied
her father. "Captain Lawrie, with three companies
was stationed at the North Bridge, just
here. The monument stands upon the very
spot where the British stood, and on yon plain
across the river is where the American militia
were when the fire of the British killed Hosmer
and Davis.</p>

<p>"Colonel Smith, in the village, heard the firing,
and sent a reinforcement to Lawrie's help; but
seeing that the militia were increasing in numbers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>they turned about and joined in the retreat.
Then the party under Captain Parsons, who, you
will remember, had gone to Colonel Barrett's to
destroy the secreted stores, returned, and were
allowed by the militia to pass the bridge unmolested."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they attack them, Captain?"
asked Eva, "weren't they strong enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but war had not yet been declared, and
the colonists had been enjoined to act only on
the defensive and let Great Britain be the
aggressor.</p>

<p>"Besides, the militia at Concord had not yet
heard of the slaughter of their brethren at Lexington.
They themselves had just killed three
British soldiers, to be sure, but it was purely in
self-defence."</p>

<p>"The British started back to Boston pretty
soon after that, didn't they, Papa?" asked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes; Colonel Smith thought it prudent, seeing
how rapidly the militia were gathering, to return
at once, and a little after twelve o'clock
began his retreat toward Lexington, covering
his main column by strong flanking guards.</p>

<p>"As you may suppose, the people had become
intensely excited by this time, and I dare say very
many were burning to avenge the slaughter of
their comrades. They no longer adhered to the
cautious counsels given them at Concord, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>secreting themselves behind barns and fences,
fired upon the British troops as they passed.
All along the line of march to Lexington the
British were terribly galled in this way. Guns
were fired with sure aim from every house, barn,
and stone wall. As we noticed in coming here
the road between this town and Lexington passes
through a hilly country, as well calculated as
possible for such work. At almost every wooded
defile numbers of the British were picked off by
concealed marksmen, and at Hardy's Hill there
was a severe skirmish.</p>

<p>"There was no longer any military order
among the Americans, but each man fought as he
deemed best. Some of them were killed by the
British flankers coming suddenly upon them in
their places of concealment, but their numbers
were comparatively small.</p>

<p>"Several of the British were shot near the
battle-ground of the morning at Lexington, and
Colonel Smith was badly wounded in the leg at
Fiske's Hill, near the town."</p>

<p>"So they didn't have a very good time on
their march back to Boston," remarked Max.</p>

<p>"No, very far from it," replied his father.
"You will remember they had been marching
the night before, marching and fighting pretty
much all that day, and attacked every now and
then by a concealed foe, who shot down one after
another; they became at last so fatigued that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>they must have surrendered to the Americans if
reinforcements had not reached them.</p>

<p>"I have said a request for help had been sent
to General Gage from Lexington early in the
morning, and he had responded with about nine
hundred men under Lord Percy,&mdash;three regiments
of infantry and two divisions of marines.
These left Boston about nine o'clock in the
morning and marched toward Lexington.</p>

<p>"As they passed through Roxbury they played
'Yankee Doodle' in derision, having before used
it as a Rogue's March."</p>

<p>"Papa," Gracie asked, "did the Roxbury
people know about the fight at Lexington and
Concord?"</p>

<p>"They had heard vague rumours of a fight at
Lexington, and the marching in that direction
of these Boston troops confirmed their worst
fears."</p>

<p>"What an excitement the marching of those
British troops must have caused all along the
way as they went!" exclaimed Eva.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Captain Raymond, "one of
their officers said, 'they [the Americans] seemed
to drop from the clouds.'"</p>

<p>"Percy's brigade met them about half a mile
from Lexington. He formed a hollow square,
and for its defence, planted a cannon on high
ground near Monroe's tavern, and received into
his enclosure the wearied troops of Smith. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>of them were so heated and worn out that they
lay exhausted and panting upon the ground,
their tongues hanging out of their mouths, as a
dog's does when he is tired and overheated.</p>

<p>"But Percy did not dare allow them to rest long,
for the militia had gathered from all quarters,
and the woods were swarming with minute-men.
They were given a little refreshment, a brief
rest, then hurried on their way, committing as
they went deeds of ruffianism of which they had
reason to be heartily ashamed; property was destroyed,
houses were plundered, and several innocent
persons were murdered.</p>

<p>"Of course the Americans were filled with indignation
as well as grief for the sufferings of
friends and neighbours, some of them their near
kindred."</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, it was just dreadful, Papa!" exclaimed
Gracie, her eyes filling with tears. "I
think the British of those days were very, very
cruel."</p>

<p>"Very true," replied her father; "there were
very many deeds of blood and violence, for
which there was no excuse, committed by them
during that war. Rawdon, Tarleton, and even
Cornwallis showed themselves men of savage
cruelty."</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Rosie, "I perfectly detest
and abhor that brutal Tarleton! No Indian was
ever more heartless and cruel than he!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think that is true," the Captain said. "He
treated American prisoners so unfortunate as
to fall into his hands, with most inhuman
cruelty; also he was so vain, conceited, and
untruthful that in a 'History of the Campaigns
of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of
North America,' which he wrote after his return
to England, he distorts events for his self-glorification
to such a degree as has seldom been
paralleled. Yes, take him all together he was,
I think, one of the most despicable characters of
the Revolution."</p>

<p>"I have always been so glad over his defeat
by Morgan at the battle of the Cowpens," said
Eva, "and have always admired the reminders
of it given him by some of the Southern ladies,
particularly of the wound on his hand that Colonel
Washington gave him in chasing him from
that battle-field."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," said Rosie. "The ladies
were great admirers of Colonel Washington,
talked a great deal about him, and at least two
or three times gave that vain, boastful, cruel
Tarleton a rub about that wound."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain, "those sallies of wit
were expended on him by two sisters,&mdash;daughters
of Colonel Montfort, of Halifax County, North
Carolina. When Cornwallis was there on his
way to Virginia, Colonel Washington was the
subject of conversation one evening; and Tarleton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>nettled doubtless by the admiration freely
expressed by the ladies, began talking against
him, saying that he was an illiterate fellow,
hardly able to write his own name.</p>

<p>"The remark was made in the presence of
Mrs. Willie Jones, one of the sisters I have
spoken of, and she replied, 'Ah, Colonel, you
ought to know better, for you bear on your
person proof that he knows very well <em>how to
make his mark</em>.'"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have liked to be in his place,"
remarked Max. "I dare say he felt like shooting
Mrs. Jones for her compliment."</p>

<p>"That is not at all unlikely," said his father.
"It is said that when her sister, Mrs. Ashe,
twitted him in like manner, he showed his temper
plainly. He had been talking again, sarcastically
of Colonel Washington, in her presence,
and finally said with a sneer, 'I would be happy
to see Colonel Washington.' To which she instantly
replied, 'If you had looked behind you,
Colonel Tarleton, at the battle of the Cowpens,
you would have enjoyed that pleasure.'"</p>

<p>"That was just good for him!" exclaimed
Lulu. "I wonder what he said to it,&mdash;if he
answered her at all."</p>

<p>"He was very angry (for no doubt the words
stung him) and laid his hand on the hilt of his
sword, while he regarded her with a frown,"
replied the Captain. "But General Leslie, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>superior officer said, 'Say what you please, Mrs.
Ashe; Colonel Tarleton knows better than to
insult a lady in my presence.'"</p>

<p>"Did Tarleton ever insult a lady, Papa?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"I have read that he once insulted an American
woman,&mdash;one who was large and strong,&mdash;and
that she knocked him down upon the floor,
seized him by the throat, and choked him till he
was black in the face; she probably would have
killed him if some one had not come to his assistance
and pulled her off."</p>

<p>"Surely he must have been proud of <em>that</em>
encounter," laughed Max.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>There were several more souvenirs of the
Revolution shown the young people by Captain
Raymond that morning,&mdash;among them Boston's
"Liberty Tree," or rather the sculptured representation
of it set within a niche on the front of
a house, and exactly over the spot on which the
tree stood before its destruction by the British
during the siege of Boston.</p>

<p>"It was under that tree the association calling
themselves 'Sons of Liberty' used to hold their
meetings," he said. "They met there in the
summer of 1765 when there was a great excitement
over the passage of the Stamp Act by the
British Parliament, and continued to do so until
the destruction of the tree by the British during
the siege of Boston, 1775. It was called 'Liberty
Tree' and the ground under it 'Liberty
Hall.'</p>

<p>"A newspaper of that time, the 'Essex Gazette,'
of Aug. 31st, 1775, describes the destruction of
the tree. It says, 'They made a furious attack
upon it and after a long spell of laughing, grinning,
sweating and foaming with malice diabolical
they cut down the tree because it bore the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>name of Liberty. A soldier was killed by falling
from one of its branches during the operation.'"</p>

<p>It was dinner time when our party reached the
hotel, where they had left Grandma Elsie and
Violet with the little ones and their maids. The
ladies had not cared to join in the morning's
excursion as they wanted to do a little shopping,
and had already seen Concord, Lexington, and
the places of historical interest in the city itself.</p>

<p>But Bunker Hill was to be visited that afternoon,
and from that little trip neither lady asked
to be excused. They all went together, starting
directly after leaving the table.</p>

<p>Every one greatly enjoyed the view from the
top of the monument: it was like a vast painting,
showing them the city of Boston with its
harbour, where could be seen vessels from almost
every part of the world, and the many towns
and villages in its vicinity, each with its own
story of its struggles for liberty in "the days that
tried men's souls." Far in the northwest the
higher peaks of New Hampshire's White Mountains
were visible: on the northeast they could
discern the peninsula of Nahant, while still
farther in the distance was Cape Ann.</p>

<p>The Captain gave them a brief account of the
erection of the monument.</p>

<p>"It was not till 1824 that a movement was
made to that end," he said. "General La Fayette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>was at the time the nation's guest, and was invited
to lay the corner-stone, which he did on the
17th of June, 1825, the fiftieth anniversary of the
battle.</p>

<p>"The Hon. Daniel Webster made an oration
on the subject to an immense crowd which had
gathered for the occasion. There were forty of
the survivors of the battle present, and probably
La Fayette met more of his fellow-soldiers of
that war then than at any other time or place."</p>

<p>"Was it finished in that year, Papa?" asked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, my child; not for seventeen
years. The last stone was raised about six
o'clock on the morning of the 23d of July, 1842,
and with it&mdash;waving the American Flag as he
went up&mdash;was Mr. Edward Carnes, Jr., of
Charlestown, the roar of cannon at the same
time announcing the event to the surrounding
country."</p>

<p>"But that wasn't the anniversary of the battle?"
remarked Rosie, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"No," the Captain said; "but on the next
anniversary,&mdash;June 17th, 1843,&mdash;the monument
was dedicated. Daniel Webster was the orator
on that occasion also, addressing a vast audience
composed of citizens and soldiers."</p>

<p>"Oh, how I would have liked to hear his
speech, if only he could have waited till I was in
this world and old enough to understand what he
was talking about!" exclaimed Rosie.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>A remark which called forth a good-humoured
laugh from her hearers.</p>

<p>"Now, Papa, the next thing is to tell us about
the battle of Bunker Hill,&mdash;isn't it?" Lulu said
with a bright, coaxing look up into his face.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he replied, with an indulgent
smile. "But first let us look at these cannon,&mdash;the
'Hancock' and the 'Adams;' you will readily
understand for whom they were named. They
belonged formerly to the Ancient and Honourable
Artillery Company. This one&mdash;the 'Adams'&mdash;you
see is not sound; it was burst in firing a
salute. You also see that they bear an inscription,
which I shall read aloud for the benefit of
the company:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Sacred to Liberty. This is one of four cannons
which constituted the whole train of field-artillery
possessed by the British colonies of North America at
the commencement of the war, on the nineteenth of
April, 1775. This cannon and its fellow, belonging to
a number of citizens of Boston, were used in many engagements
during the war. The other two, the property
of the government of Massachusetts, were taken
by the enemy. By order of the United States in
Congress assembled, May nineteenth, 1788."</p></div>

<p>"What strong faith in God and the righteousness
of their cause they must have had, to begin
a war with Great Britain with only four cannon
in their possession!" remarked Grandma
Elsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," responded the Captain; "and it was
by His good help that they conquered in spite of
the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their
way. It was a fearful struggle, but with God
and the armies of heaven on their side they could
not fail.</p>

<p>"The events of that ever-memorable 19th of
April were speedily heralded over the whole land,
from the scenes of their occurrence down to South
Carolina and Georgia, west to the first settlers of
Kentucky, and north to Montreal and Quebec.</p>

<p>"It electrified its hearers, and with one impulse
they of the colonies&mdash;soon to become States&mdash;sprang
to arms. As Bancroft says, 'With one
spirit they pledged themselves to each other to be
ready for the extreme event.' With one heart
the continent cried, 'Liberty or death!'</p>

<p>"The Massachusetts Committee of Safety sent
a circular to the several towns of that State,
conjuring them to encourage enlistments by
every means in their power, and send the troops
forward to headquarters at Cambridge with the
expedition that the urgency and importance of
the affair demanded. But the people had not
waited for the call.</p>

<p>"Hearing of the slaughter of their brethren,
men snatched their firelocks from the walls and
rushed to the camp, often with scarcely any preparation,
some of them with almost no provision,
no money in their pockets, and only the clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>on their backs. They were hastening to the
defence of their country and their endangered
brethren.</p>

<p>"So Boston was besieged; Prescott of Pepperell
and his Middlesex minute-men kept watch over
the entrance to that city. Gage was forced to
fortify the town at all points, while the Americans
talked of driving him and his troops into the sea.</p>

<p>"New Hampshire sent men under the command
of John Stark, a noble fellow well known
as brave, fearless, and worthy of all confidence.</p>

<p>"Israel Putnam was another, who, hearing the
cry from Lexington, which reached him on the
morning after the battle, while he was helping
his hired men to build a stone wall on his farm,
hurried thither without waiting to so much as
change the check shirt he was wearing in the
field; though first he roused the militia officers of
the nearest towns.</p>

<p>"He reached Cambridge by sunrise the next
morning, having ridden the same horse a hundred
miles in eighteen hours. He was full of
courage and love for his country, and hundreds
had already chosen him for their leader.</p>

<p>"Benedict Arnold was still another who made
haste to Boston to assist in the siege. By the
21st of April it was estimated that twenty thousand
men were collected about that city.</p>

<p>"The battle of Bunker Hill, you will recollect,
was not fought till the 17th of June. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>all the intervening time the Americans had kept
the British officers and their troops besieged
in Boston, and they were beginning to be much
ashamed of their confinement.</p>

<p>"The Americans had decided to throw up a
breast-work across the road near Prospect Hill,
and to fortify Bunker Hill as soon as a supply
of powder and artillery could be obtained; but
learning that Gage had planned to extend his
lines north and south over Dorchester and
Charlestown, and had fixed upon the eighteenth
of June for so doing, they decided to anticipate
his movement, and on the fifteenth of that month
the Massachusetts Committee of Safety informed
the Council of War that, in their opinion, Dorchester
Heights should be fortified; and they
recommended unanimously the establishing of a
post on Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>"The choice of an officer to conduct the enterprise
fell upon William Prescott, who was
colonel of a regiment; and the next evening a
brigade of a thousand men was put under his
command.</p>

<p>"Soon after sunset they paraded on Cambridge
Common. They were not in uniform as American
troops would be in these days, nor had they
such arms; for the most part they had fowling-pieces,&mdash;no
bayonets to them,&mdash;and only a
small supply of powder and bullets, which they
carried in horns and pouches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>"Four days previously a proclamation had been
issued threatening all persons in arms against
their sovereign with death under martial law,
by the cord as rebels and traitors. That
menace these men were the first to defy; and
he, Prescott, was resolved 'never to be taken
alive.'</p>

<p>"Langdon, the president of Harvard College,
prayed fervently with them. Then as it began to
grow dark on that summer night, they marched
silently and without noise across the narrow
isthmus, taking with them their wagons with intrenching
tools; and Prescott, calling around
him his officers and Richard Gridley, an experienced
engineer, consulted with them as to
the spot on which they should erect their earthworks.</p>

<p>"Bunker Hill had been proposed by the committee,
but Prescott had received orders to march
to Breed's Hill, and obeyed them. It was nearer
Boston, and he and his companions thought it
better suited than the other for annoying the
British in the town and the shipping in the
harbour.</p>

<p>"So the engineer drew there, by the light of
the stars, the lines of a redoubt nearly eight rods
square. The bells of Boston had struck twelve
before they began their work by turning the first
sod, but every man of the thousand plied the
pickaxe and spade in turn, and so rapidly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>the parapet soon assumed form and height
sufficient for defence, and Prescott said to
himself, 'We shall keep our ground if some
screen, however slight, can be completed before
discovery.'</p>

<p>"He set a watch to patrol the shore, and
twice went down to the margin of the water, on
which three British vessels lay at anchor,&mdash;the
'Lively' in the ferry between Boston and Charlestown,
and a little to the eastward of her the
'Falcon,' sloop-of-war, and the 'Somerset,' a ship-of-the-line,&mdash;and
listening intently he could hear
the drowsy cry of the sentinels on their decks,
'All is well.'"</p>

<p>Captain Raymond paused and looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>"It is time we were going," he said. "I will
just point out to you all the localities made interesting
by the events of that day, and finish my
story on board the 'Dolphin,' to which we are
just about to return. We may be in the way of
other visitors here, but there will be quite to
ourselves, and an annoyance to no one."</p>

<p>They went back to their hotel, where the
Captain left them for a little, saying he had some
purchases to make for use on the voyage, but
would return shortly to see them on board the
yacht.</p>

<p>He was not gone very long, and on his return
the entire party&mdash;with the exception of Donald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>Keith who had bidden them farewell early that
morning&mdash;returned with him to the "Dolphin,"
which presently sailed out of the harbour and
pursued her way up along the New England
coast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>The evening proved a rainy one and cool for
the season; but the "Dolphin's" cabin was found
an agreeable resort. All gathered there, and at
once there was an urgent request from the young
people that the interrupted story of the battle of
Bunker Hill might be resumed.</p>

<p>"You know, Papa, we left off just where
Prescott's men were digging and making a redoubt,"
said Lulu. "The night before the battle,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "The British were greatly
astonished when daylight revealed the work that
had been going on during the hours of darkness;
for it was done so quietly that their suspicions
had not been aroused.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No shout disturbed the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before that fearful fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no boasting high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No marshalling of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ne'er might meet again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cup was filled and quaffed to victory!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No plumes were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No banners fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No trumpets breathed around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the drum's startling sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke on the midnight air."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
<p>"What nice verses, Papa!" said Gracie.
"Did you make them yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, daughter," he replied, "it was merely
a quotation from John Neal, one of our own
American poets.</p>

<p>"But to go on with my story. As soon as the
British discovered the redoubt our men had constructed
on Breed's Hill, the captain of the 'Lively'
put springs on his cables and opened a fire upon
it without waiting for orders.</p>

<p>"The noise of the cannon aroused the sleeping
people of Boston, and by the time the sun was up
every eminence and roof in the city swarmed
with them, all gazing with astonished eyes upon
the strange apparition on Breed's Hill. The
'Lively's' shots did no harm, and the Americans
went on as before with their work. They were
behind their intrenchments busied in strengthening
them, and toiled on till pick and shovel had to
be laid aside for guns to defend them with.</p>

<p>"The firing presently ceased for a little, by
order of Admiral Graves, the British naval commander-in-chief,
but was soon resumed by the
shipping, while a battery of six guns on Copp's
Hill in the city joined in with them.</p>

<p>"Early that morning the British general, Gage,
called a council of war, and it was decided to
drive the Americans out of their works, and that
the attack should be made in front.</p>

<p>"Boston was full of excitement, drums were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>beating, dragoons galloping about the streets,
regulars and royalists marching and counter-marching,
artillery trains rumbling and church-bells
ringing."</p>

<p>"Ah, how the hearts of wives and mothers,
brothers and sisters, must have been torn at
thought of the terrible struggle just at hand!"
sighed Grandma Elsie, as the Captain paused for
a moment in his narrative.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "then and still more when
from the roofs, steeples, and every sort of elevation,
they watched with streaming eyes the progress
of the fight after it had actually begun."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Gracie, "how glad and
thankful I am that God let us live in these
later days when there is no war in our dear
country!</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child, we should thank God for
peace," her father responded, softly smoothing
her hair and pressing his lips to her cheek for an
instant as she stood by his side, her head resting
lovingly on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The Americans worked faithfully on their
intrenchments all the morning," he continued,
"Prescott doing all he could to encourage them
by his voice and example, even walking leisurely
around upon the parapet in full view of the British
officers who were still in Boston.</p>

<p>"It is said that Gage was looking at the
American works through a field-glass, and saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Prescott, who was a tall man of commanding
appearance, going his rounds, and that he inquired
of Counsellor Willard, a brother-in-law of
Prescott, who was standing near, who it was.</p>

<p>"'That is Colonel Prescott,' was the reply.</p>

<p>"'Will he fight?' asked Gage.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' answered Willard, 'he is an old
soldier, and will fight as long as a drop of blood
remains in his veins.'</p>

<p>"'The works must be carried immediately,'
was Gage's rejoinder, and he at once proceeded to
give the order for the attack.</p>

<p>"He sent between two and three thousand
picked men under the command of Generals Howe
and Pigot. They crossed the water in twenty-eight
barges, and landed at Morton's Point beyond
the eastern foot of Breed's Hill, covered by
the guns of the 'Falcon' and other vessels. There
they waited for reinforcements, which were sent
Howe about two o'clock.</p>

<p>"While the troops of Howe and Pigot were
waiting, they dined; but the poor Americans behind
their intrenchments, at which they had been
working all the morning as well as from twelve
o'clock of the previous night, had little or nothing
to eat or drink, and were suffering with hunger,
thirst, and the extreme heat of the weather as
well as fatigue, for the day was one of the hottest
of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides, the reinforcements sent to their assistance
were so few and feeble that a dreadful
suspicion arose in their minds that they were the
victims of treachery.</p>

<p>"Still they could not doubt the patriotism of
their principal officers; and before the battle
began, the arrival of their beloved Dr. Warren
and General Pomeroy entirely relieved their
doubts.</p>

<p>"Dr. Warren was suffering from sickness and
exhaustion; and Putnam, who was at Cambridge
forwarding reinforcements and provisions to
Charlestown, tried to persuade him not to take
part in the coming fight. But his heart was in
the cause, and he was not to be induced to give
up doing all he could to help in the approaching
struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>"He mounted a horse, sped across the neck,
and just as Howe gave orders to advance, entered
the redoubt amid the loud cheers of the men who
so loved and trusted him."</p>

<p>"Such a lovely man, and ardent patriot as he
was!" exclaimed Violet. "Oh, it makes my
heart ache to think that he was killed in that
battle."</p>

<p>"It was a very great loss to the American
cause," responded her husband, taking a book
from a table near at hand as he spoke. "This,"
he said, "is Bancroft's History, which I bought
this afternoon that I might have his help in going
over the story of the battle of Bunker Hill and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>other interesting events of the Revolution. This
is what he says of Joseph Warren:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"In him were combined swiftness of thought and resolve,
courage, endurance, and manners which won
universal love. He opposed the British government
not from interested motives nor from resentment.
Guileless and intrepid, he was in truth a patriot. As
the moment for the appeal to arms approached, he
watched with joy the revival of the generous spirit of
New England's ancestors; and wherever the peril was
greatest he was present animating not by words alone,
but ever by his example.</p>

<p>"His integrity, the soundness of his judgment, his
ability to write readily and well, his fervid eloquence,
his exact acquaintance with American rights and
the infringements of them, gave authority to his advice
in private and in the provincial congress. Had
he lived, the future seemed burdened with his honors;
he cheerfully sacrificed all for the freedom of his
country and the rights of man."</p></div>

<p>"He left some children, if I remember right?"
remarked Violet in a tone of inquiry, as her
husband paused in his reading.</p>

<p>"Yes, four of them," answered the Captain;
"and his wife having died about two years before,
they were now left orphans, in straitened
circumstances.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me of a good deed done by
Gen. Benedict Arnold. He was a warm friend
of Warren, and for that reason came to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>relief, himself contributing five hundred dollars
for their education, and obtaining from Congress
the amount of a major-general's half pay, to be
applied to their support from the time of their
father's death until the youngest child should be
of age.</p>

<p>"But to go on with the account of the battle.
Warren had been entreated not thus to expose
his life. His answer was, 'It is sweet and becoming
to die for one's country.' He saw all
the difficulties in the way of his countrymen, and
desired to give all the help in his power.</p>

<p>"Putnam expressed himself as ready to receive
his orders; but Warren declined to take the command
from him, and passed on to the redoubt
which seemed likely to be the chief point of attack
by the enemy.</p>

<p>"Prescott there offered the command to him,
as Putnam had just done; but Warren again
declined, saying, 'I come as a volunteer, to
learn from a soldier of experience.' This though
three days before he had been elected a provincial
major-general.</p>

<p>"After the British had landed and before the
battle began, Col. John Stark arrived with his
New Hampshire troops. Except Prescott he
brought the largest number into the field. He
was a very brave man, and so cool and collected
that he marched leisurely across the isthmus,
raked by the cannon of the enemy; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>one of his captains advised a quickstep, he
replied, 'One fresh man in action is worth ten
fatigued ones.'</p>

<p>"There was not time for him to consult with
Prescott. They fought independently,&mdash;Prescott
at his redoubt, Stark and Knowlton, and
Reed's regiment to protect its flank.</p>

<p>"Months before that,&mdash;two days after the
battle of Concord,&mdash;Gage had threatened to
burn Charlestown in case the Americans should
occupy the heights. So an order was now given
to set it on fire, and it was done by shells from
Copp's Hill; the houses being mostly of wood,
two hundred of them were soon in flames.</p>

<p>"The British thought to be protected in their
advance by the smoke of the burning houses,
but a gentle breeze, the first that had been felt
that day, arose and wafted it aside, so that
they were not hidden from the eyes of the
Americans.</p>

<p>"It was somewhere between two and three
o'clock when the British began their approach.
They were in two columns, one led by Howe,
the other by Pigot, Howe no doubt expecting
to get into Prescott's rear and force him to a
surrender. But I will give another extract from
Bancroft.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"As they began to march, the battery on Copp's
Hill, from which Clinton and Burgoyne were watching
every movement, kept up an incessant fire, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>was seconded by the 'Falcon' and the 'Lively,' the
'Somerset' and the two floating batteries; the town
of Charlestown, consisting of five hundred edifices of
wood, burst into a blaze; and the steeple of its only
church became a pyramid of fire. All the while the
masts of the British shipping and the heights of the
British camp, the church towers, the house tops of a
populous town, and the acclivities of the surrounding
country, were crowded with spectators to watch the
battle which was to take place in full sight on a conspicuous
eminence."</p></div>

<p>"Oh, Papa," pleaded Gracie, as he paused
for an instant, "please tell it. I like that so
much better than listening to reading."</p>

<p>"Quite a compliment to me as a reader," he
returned with an amused look.</p>

<p>"No, sir, as a talker. I like to hear you tell
things," she responded, with a sweet, engaging
smile.</p>

<p>"Do you, dear child? Very well, I'll try to
gratify you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"When Prescott saw the red-coats moving
toward his redoubt he ordered two separate detachments
to flank the enemy, then went through
his works encouraging his men, to whom this
was an entirely new experience. 'The red-coats
will never reach the redoubt,' he said, 'if
you will but withhold your fire till I give the
order; and be careful not to shoot over their
heads.' Then he waited till the enemy had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>within a few rods, when waving his sword over
his head he gave the word, 'Fire!'</p>

<p>"Every gun was instantly discharged, and
nearly the whole of the front rank fell; the rest,
astonished at this unexpected resistance, stood
still. Then for some minutes the fire of the
Americans continued, answered by the British,
till at last they staggered, wavered, then fled
down the hill toward their boats.</p>

<p>"Howe had been treated to a like reception
by Stark's and Knowlton's troops, cheered on by
Putnam who, like Prescott, bade them reserve
their fire till the best moment, when they poured
in one as deadly and destructive as that which
came from Prescott's redoubt."</p></div>

<p>"Wasn't Prescott's order to his men to reserve
their fire till they could see the whites of
the British soldier's eyes?" queried Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes, so Lossing tells us; and that he added,
'Then aim at their waistbands; and be sure to
pick off the commanders, known by their handsome
coats.'</p>

<p>"His men were filled with joy when they saw
the British fly, and wanted to pursue them, some
even leaping the fence; but their more prudent
officers restrained them, and in a few minutes
they were all within their works again, and
ready to receive and repulse a second attack.</p>

<p>"Colonel Prescott praised and encouraged them
while Putnam rode over to Bunker Hill to urge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>on reinforcement; but 'few additional troops
could be brought to Breed's Hill before the
second attack was made.' Before that the British
were reinforced by four hundred marines
from Boston, then they moved against the redoubt
in the same order as at first, their artillery
doing more damage to the Americans than in
the first assault."</p>

<p>"Papa," asked Gracie, "what had become
of the wounded men they'd left lying on the
ground?&mdash;those the Americans shot down at
their first fire over the redoubt?"</p>

<p>"They were still lying there on the ground
where they had fallen, poor fellows! and the
others marched over them. Ah, war is a dreadful
thing, and those who forced it upon the
patient, long-suffering Americans were either
very thoughtless or exceeding cruel."</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Rosie, "I don't know what
George III. could have been made of to be willing
to cause so much suffering even to innocent
defenceless women and children, just that he
might play the tyrant and forcibly take from the
Americans their own hard earnings to pay his
way."</p>

<p>"He was perhaps not quite so wicked as
weak," replied her mother; "you know, I think,
that he afterward lost his mind several times.
Indeed he had done so once before this,&mdash;in
1764."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>"He had been wicked and cruel enough for a
guilty conscience to set him crazy, I should
think," remarked Max.</p>

<p>"Please go on, again, Papa, won't you?"
entreated Lulu.</p>

<p>"I will," he said. "The British fired as they
drew near, but with little effect; and the Americans,
reserving their fire as before, till the foe
was within five or six yards of the redoubt, then
poured it on them with deadly aim, as at the
first attack. It told with terrible effect; whole
ranks of officers and men fell dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't they run then, Papa?" queried
Gracie with a shudder of horror as she seemed
to see the ground strewed with the dead and
dying.</p>

<p>"They were thrown into confusion and retreated
to the shore," the Captain replied,&mdash;"retreated
in great disorder. It seemed that the
American fire was even more fatal than before.
In telling the story afterward Prescott said,
'From the whole American line there was a
continuous stream of fire.'</p>

<p>"The British officers exposed themselves fearlessly,
and urged their soldiers on with persuasions,
threats, and even blows; but they could
not reach the redoubt, and presently gave way,
and, as I have said, retreated in great disorder.</p>

<p>"At one time Howe was left nearly alone for
a few seconds, so many of his officers had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>killed or wounded; while 'the dead,' as Stark
said in his account of the battle, 'lay as thick
as sheep in a fold.'</p>

<p>"Now I think my little Gracie will have to put
up with some more reading," added the Captain,
with a smiling glance at her; then opening his
book, read aloud,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"At intervals the artillery from the ships and batteries
was playing, while the flames were rising over
the town of Charlestown and laying waste the places
of the graves of its fathers, and streets were falling together,
and ships at the yards were crashing on the
stocks, and the kindred of the Americans, from the
fields, and hills and house-tops around, watched every
gallant act of their defenders. 'The whole,' wrote
Burgoyne, 'was a complication of horror and importance
beyond anything it ever came to my lot to be
witness to. It was a sight for a young soldier that the
longest service may not furnish again."</p></div>

<p>"If," remarked Captain Raymond, again closing
the book, "it was so dreadful a sight for
soldiers accustomed to the horrors of war, what
must it not have been to the American farmers
taking their first lesson in war? But not
one of them shrank from duty. I think we may
be very proud of those countrymen of ours.
Prescott said to his men, 'If we drive them back
once more they cannot rally again.' At that his
men cheered him, and shouted. 'We are ready
for the red-coats again.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>"But alas! the officers now discovered that
the supply of gunpowder was nearly exhausted.
Prescott had sent in the morning for more, but it
had not come; and there were not fifty bayonets
in his party."</p>

<p>"They were wonderfully brave to stand for a
third attack under such circumstances," remarked
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"They were indeed," responded the Captain.
"No one of the seven hundred men with Prescott
seems to have thought of giving up the contest
without another effort. Some gathered stones
from the redoubt to use as missiles, those who
had no bayonets resolved to club their guns and
strike with them when their powder should be
gone; all were determined to fight as long as a
ray of hope of success could be discerned. And
they did.</p>

<p>"They waited with quiet firmness the approach
of the enemy who came steadily on with fixed
bayonets, while their cannon were so trained that
they swept the interior of the breast-work from
one end to the other, obliging the Americans to
crowd within their fort.</p>

<p>"The Americans were presently attacked on
three sides, at once; and there were, as I have
said, but seven hundred of them, some of whom
had no more than one round of ammunition, none
of them more than four. But they did not quail,
and Prescott calmly gave his directions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>"He bade his men wait, reserving their fire
till the enemy was within twenty yards. Then
they poured in a deadly volley. Every shot told.
Howe was wounded in the foot, and several of his
officers were killed besides the common soldiers.
But they pressed on to the now nearly silent redoubt,
for the American fire had slackened and
begun to die away.</p>

<p>"And now there was only a ridge of earth between
the combatants, and the first of the British
who reached it were assailed with a shower of
stones. Then some of them scaled the parapet
and were shot down in the act. One of these
was Major Pitcairn, who had led the troops at
Lexington. As he mounted the parapet he cried
out, 'Now for the glory of the marines!' and was
answered by a shot from a negro that gave him a
mortal wound. His son carried him to a boat,
conveyed him to Boston, and there he soon died."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Gracie, "I hope that brave
Colonel Prescott didn't get killed, Papa!"</p>

<p>"No; he escaped unhurt, though his coat and
waistcoat were pierced and torn in several places
by the bayonets of the British, which he parried
with his sword.</p>

<p>"It was now a hand-to-hand fight, British and
Americans mingled together, our men walking
backward and hewing their way out, dealing
deadly blows with their muskets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fortunately the British were too much exhausted
to use their bayonets with vigour; and so
intermingled were they and the Americans that
the use of firearms would have been dangerous to
their own men as well as to ours."</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed Rosie, "I have always been so
sorry that our men didn't have plenty of gunpowder!
I don't think there's a doubt that if
they had been well supplied with it, they would
have won a grand victory."</p>

<p>"Yes; they did wonders considering all they
had to contend with," said the Captain. "Their
courage, endurance, and skill as marksmen astonished
the British, and were never forgotten by
them during the long war that followed.</p>

<p>"The number engaged in the battle of Bunker
Hill was small, all taken together not more than
fifteen hundred of the Americans,&mdash;less than
seven hundred in the redoubt,&mdash;while of the
British there were, according to Gage, more than
two thousand; other and accurate observers said,
'near upon three thousand.'</p>

<p>"But in spite of the smallness of the numbers
engaged, the battle was one of the severest and
most determined on record. Neither side could
claim a victory, but both displayed great courage
and determination."</p>

<p>"And Joseph Warren was one of the killed!"
sighed Grandma Elsie, "one of the bravest, best,
and most lovable of men, as those who knew him
have testified. I remember reading that Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>John Adams said of him and his death, 'Not all
the havoc and devastation they have made has
wounded me like the death of Warren. We
want him in the Senate; we want him in his profession;
we want him in the field. We mourn
for the citizen, the senator, the physician, and
the warrior.' General Howe said, 'His death was
worth more to the British than that of five hundred
of the provincial privates.'"</p>

<p>"And that was not an over-estimate, I think,"
said the Captain. "It was indeed a sad loss to
the cause of the colonies when he was slain."</p>

<p>"But there were more of the British killed
than of our men,&mdash;weren't there, Papa?" asked
Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes, very many more. By Gage's own account
the number of killed and wounded in his
army was at least one thousand and fifty-four.
The oldest soldiers had never seen anything like
it,&mdash;so many officers killed and wounded. Bancroft
tells us that the battle of Quebec, which
won a continent, did not cost the lives of so
many officers as the battle of Bunker Hill, which
gained nothing 'but a place of encampment.'</p>

<p>"The American loss was one hundred and
forty-five in killed and missing, three hundred
and four wounded. No doubt the loss would
have been very much greater but for the brave
conduct of the men at the rail fence and the
bank of the Mystic, who kept the enemy at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>bay while the men from the redoubt retreated.
You may remember that they were Stark's men
from New Hampshire and Knowlton's from
Connecticut."</p>

<p>"I hope the result of the battle encouraged
the Americans as much as it discouraged the
British," remarked Rosie, "and I think I have
read that it did."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Captain replied, "it did. In his
general order, thanking the officers and soldiers
for their gallant behaviour at Charlestown, Ward
said, 'We shall finally come off victorious,
and triumph over the enemies of freedom and
America.'"</p>

<p>"Did they fight any more that night, Papa?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "though Prescott went to
headquarters and offered to recover his post if he
might have three fresh regiments. He did not
seem to think he had done anything more than
his duty, and asked for neither praise nor promotion,
though others gave him unstinted praise
for what he had done.</p>

<p>"Putnam was absent from the field, engaged
in trying to collect reinforcements, when the
third attack was made, and the retreating party
encountered him on the northern declivity of
Bunker Hill. He tried to stop and turn them
about,&mdash;commanded, pleaded, and used every
exertion in his power to rally the scattered corps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>swearing that victory should crown the American
arms. 'Make a stand here; we can stop them
yet!' he exclaimed. 'In God's name, fire,
and give them one shot more!'</p>

<p>"It is said that after the war was over he
made a sincere confession to the church of which
he was a member; but he said, 'It was almost
enough to make an angel swear to see the cowards
refuse to secure a victory so nearly won.'"</p>

<p>"And couldn't he stop them, Papa?" asked
Gracie.</p>

<p>"He succeeded with some few," replied her
father, "joined them to a detachment which had
not reached the spot till the fighting was over,
and with them took possession of Prospect Hill,
where he encamped for the night."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, what did they do with all those
Americans and British who had been killed?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"There must have been many a sad funeral,"
the Captain said in reply, "many a widow and
fatherless child to weep over the slain. Ah, let
us thank our heavenly Father for the liberty and
security bought for us at so fearful a price."</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Grandma Elsie; "and let
us keep them for ourselves and our children
by the eternal vigilance which is the price of
liberty.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>To the great delight of the young people on
board the "Dolphin" the sun shone in a clear
sky the next morning.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast they were all on deck, as
usual in pleasant weather, enjoying the breeze,
the sight of passing vessels, and a distant view
of the land.</p>

<p>The Captain and Violet sat near together with
the two little ones playing about them, while
Grandma Elsie, in a reclining chair, at no great
distance, seemed absorbed in a book.</p>

<p>"Mamma is reading something sad, I know
by the look on her face," said Walter, hurrying
toward her, the others following. "What is it
you are reading, Mamma, that makes you look
so sorry?" he asked, putting an arm about her
neck, and giving her a kiss. "Oh, that's Bancroft's
History!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I was just looking over
his account of the battles of Lexington and
Concord, and some things he tells do make me
sad though they happened more than a hundred
years ago."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, please read them to us!" pleaded several
young voices, all speaking at once.</p>

<p>"I will give you some passages," she said;
"not the whole, because you have already been
over that ground. It is what he tells of Isaac
Davis that particularly interests me," and she
began reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"At daybreak the minute-men of Acton crowded,
at the drum-beat, to the house of Isaac Davis, their
captain, who 'made haste to be ready.' Just thirty
years old, the father of four little ones, stately in his
person, a man of few words, earnest even to solemnity,
he parted from his wife, saying, 'Take good care of
the children;' and while she gazed after him with
resignation, he led off his company.</p>

<p>"Between nine and ten the number of Americans on
the rising ground above Concord Bridge had increased
to more than four hundred. Of these there were
twenty-five minute-men from Bedford, with Jonathan
Wilson for their captain; others were from Westford,
among them Thaxter, a preacher; others from Littleton,
from Carlisle, and from Chelmsford. The
Acton company came last and formed on the right.
The whole was a gathering not so much of officers and
soldiers as of brothers and equals, of whom every one
was a man well known in his village, observed in the
meeting-house on Sundays, familiar at town meetings
and respected as a freeholder or a freeholder's son....
'The Americans had as yet received only uncertain
rumors of the morning's events at Lexington. At the
sight of fire in the village, the impulse seized them to
march into the town for its defence.' But were they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>not subjects of the British king? Had not the troops
come out in obedience to acknowledged authorities?
Was resistance practicable? Was it justifiable? By
whom could it be authorized? No union had been
formed, no independence proclaimed, no war declared.
The husbandmen and mechanics who then stood on the
hillock by Concord river were called on to act, and
their action would be war or peace, submission or independence.
Had they doubted they must have despaired.
Prudent statesmanship would have asked for time to
ponder. Wise philosophy would have lost from hesitation
the glory of opening a new era on mankind. The
train-bands at Concord acted and God was with them.</p>

<p>"The American revolution grew out of the soul of
the people, and was an inevitable result of a living affection
for freedom, which set in motion harmonious
effort as certainly as the beating of the heart sends
warmth and color through the system. The rustic
heroes of that hour obeyed the simplest, the highest,
and the surest instincts, of which the seminal principle
existed in all their countrymen. From necessity they
were impelled toward independence and self-direction;
this day revealed the plastic will which was to attract
the elements of a nation to a centre, and by an innate
force to shape its constitution.</p>

<p>"The officers, meeting in front of their men, spoke
a few words with one another, and went back to their
places. Barrett, the colonel, on horseback in the rear,
then gave the order to advance, but not to fire unless
attacked. The calm features of Isaac Davis, of Acton,
became changed; the town school-master of Concord,
who was present, could never afterward find words
strong enough to express how deeply his face reddened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>at the word of command. 'I have not a man that is
afraid to go,' said Davis, looking at the men of Acton,
and drawing his sword, he cried, 'March!' His company,
being on the right, led the way toward the bridge,
he himself at their head, and by his side Major John
Buttrick, of Concord, with John Robinson, of Westford,
lieutenant-colonel in Prescott's regiment, but on
this day a volunteer, without command.</p>

<p>"These three men walked together in front, followed
by minute-men and militia, in double file, trailing
arms. They went down the hillock, entered the byroad,
came to its angle with the main road, and there
turned into the causeway that led straight to the
bridge. The British began to take up the planks; to
prevent it, the Americans quickened their step. At
this the British fired one or two shots up the river;
then another, by which Luther Blanchard and Jonas
Brown were wounded. A volley followed, and Isaac
Davis and Abner Hosmer fell dead. Three hours before,
Davis had bid his wife farewell. That afternoon
he was carried home and laid in her bedroom. His
countenance was pleasant in death. The bodies of two
others of his company, who were slain that day, were
brought to her house, and the three were followed to
the village graveyard by a concourse of the neighbors
from miles around. Heaven gave her length of days
in the land which his self-devotion assisted to redeem.
She lived to see her country reach the Gulf of Mexico
and the Pacific; when it was grown great in numbers,
wealth, and power, the United States in Congress bethought
themselves to pay honors to her husband's
martyrdom, and comfort her under the double burden
of sorrow and of more than ninety years."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ninety years!" exclaimed Walter. "Oh
what an old, <em>old</em> woman she was! I think they
ought to have given it to her a great deal sooner,&mdash;don't
you, Mamma?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," she replied. "What a dreadful
time it was! The British soldiery behaved like
savages or demons,&mdash;burning houses, murdering
innocent unarmed people. One poor woman&mdash;a
Mrs. Adams, ill in bed, with a baby only a week
old&mdash;was driven out of her bed, out of her
house, and had to crawl almost naked to a corn-shed
with her little one in her arms, while the
soldiers set fire to her house.</p>

<p>"They shot and killed an idiot perched on a
fence looking at them as they passed; and they
brutally murdered two aged, helpless, unarmed
old men, stabbing them, breaking their skulls and
dashing out their brains."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder the Americans shot down
as many of them as they could!" exclaimed
Max, in tones of hot indignation. "Men that
did such things were not brave soldiers, but worse
savages than the Indians. Oh, how I wish our
people had had the abundance of good weapons
and powder and balls that we have now! Then
they'd have taught the insolent British a good
lesson; they would soon have driven Gage and
all his savage soldiery into the sea."</p>

<p>"I presume they would," said Mrs. Travilla;
"but poor fellows! they were very destitute of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>such needed supplies. This is what Bancroft
says about it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"All the following night, the men of Massachusetts
streamed in from scores of miles around, old men as
well as young. They had scarce a semblance of
artillery or warlike stores, no powder, nor organization,
nor provisions; but there they were, thousands
with brave hearts, determined to rescue the liberties
of their country.</p>

<p>"The night preceding the outrages at Lexington
there were not fifty people in the whole colony that
ever expected any blood would be shed in the contest;
the night after, the king's governor and the king's
army found themselves closely beleaguered in Boston."</p></div>

<p>"Did the news fly very fast all over the
country, Mamma?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Very fast for those times," she replied;
"you must remember that then they had neither
railroads nor telegraph, but as Bancroft says,
'Heralds by swift relays transmitted the war
messages from hand to hand, till village repeated
it to village; the sea to the backwoods; the
plains to the highlands; and it was never suffered
to droop till it had been borne north and
south, east and west, throughout the land.'"</p>

<p>"But there wasn't any more fighting till the
battle of Bunker Hill, was there, Mamma?"
asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "there was the taking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Ticonderoga and Crown Point early in May, by
a party under the command of Ethan Allen;
there were about a hundred 'Green Mountain
Boys' and nearly fifty soldiers from Massachusetts
besides the men of Connecticut. The thing
was planned in Connecticut, and the expense
borne there.</p>

<p>"Allen marched in the night to the shore of
the lake opposite to Ticonderoga. A farmer
named Beman offered his son Nathan as a guide,
saying that he (the lad) had been used to playing
about the fort with the boys of the garrison, and
knew of every secret way leading into it.</p>

<p>"Allen accepted the offer, but there was a
difficulty about getting boats in which to cross
the lake. They had but few and day began to
dawn. If the garrison should be aroused their
expedition was likely to fail, for a great deal
depended upon taking them by surprise; so
Allen decided not to wait for the rear division
to cross, but to make the attempt with the officers
and eighty-three men who were already on
that side. He drew up his men in three ranks
on the shore and made them a little speech in
a low tone: 'Friends and fellow-soldiers, we
must this morning quit our pretensions to valour,
or possess ourselves of this fortress; and inasmuch
as it is a desperate attempt, I do not urge
it on, contrary to will. You that will undertake
voluntarily, poise your firelock.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>"Instantly every firelock was poised. 'Face
to the right!' he cried, putting himself at
their head, Benedict Arnold close at his side,
and they marched quietly and steadily up to
the gate.</p>

<p>"The sentinel there snapped his fusee at Allen,
but it missed fire, and he retreated within the
fort. The Americans rushed in after him, another
sentinel made a thrust at one of them, but
they ran upon the guard, raising the Indian war-whoop,
Allen giving the sentinel a blow upon
the head with his sword that made him beg for
quarter.</p>

<p>"Of course the shout of our men had roused
the garrison; and they sprang from their beds,
and came rushing out only to be made prisoners.</p>

<p>"Then young Beman guided Allen to the door
of the sleeping apartment of Delaplace, the commander.
The loud shout of the Americans had
waked him and his wife, and both sprang to the
door as Allen gave three loud raps upon it with
his sword and thundered out an order for the
commander to appear if he wouldn't have his
whole garrison sacrificed.</p>

<p>"Delaplace threw open the door, showing himself
only half dressed, in shirt and drawers, with
his pretty wife standing behind him peering over
his shoulder. He immediately recognized Allen,
for they were old friends, and assuming an air
of authority, demanded his errand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>"Allen pointed to his men and said sternly,
'I order you instantly to surrender.'</p>

<p>"'By what authority do you demand it?' asked
Delaplace.</p>

<p>"'In the name of the Great Jehovah and the
Continental Congress,' thundered Allen, and
raising his sword over his prisoner's head, commanded
him to be silent and surrender immediately.</p>

<p>"Delaplace saw that it was useless to refuse,
so surrendered, ordered his men to parade without
arms, and gave them up as prisoners. There
were forty-eight of them; and they, with the
women and children, were sent to Hartford as
prisoners of war."</p>

<p>"And what did our men get besides the soldiers
and women and children, Mamma?" asked
Walter.</p>

<p>"Cannon, and guns of various kinds, other
munitions of war, a quantity of provisions and
material for boat building, and so forth, besides
the fortress itself, which Bancroft says had 'cost
the British nation eight millions sterling, a succession
of campaigns, and many lives, yet was
won in ten minutes by a few undisciplined volunteers,
without the loss of life or limb.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was the very best of it, I think,"
said Gracie. "War wouldn't be so very, very
dreadful if it was all like that,&mdash;would it, Grandma
Elsie?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>"No dear," Mrs. Travilla replied, smiling lovingly
upon the little girl, and softly smoothing
her golden curls.</p>

<p>"Was there any other fighting before the battle
of Bunker Hill, Mamma?" queried Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "there were some encounters
along this New England coast."</p>

<p>"And Crown Point was taken too,&mdash;wasn't
it, Mamma?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! I had forgotten that part of my
story," replied her mother. "It was taken two
days later than Ticonderoga, also without any
bloodshed. About the same time that Ticonderoga
was taken, there was a British ship called the
'Canceaux' in the harbour of Portland. The captain's
name was Mowat. On the 11th of May
he and two of his officers were on shore, when a
party of sixty men from Georgetown seized them.</p>

<p>"The officer who had been left in command of
the vessel threatened what he would do if they
were not released, and even began to bombard
the town. Mowat was released at a late hour,
but felt angry and revengeful, and succeeded in
rousing the same sort of feeling in the admiral
of the station.</p>

<p>"A month later the people of a town called
Machias seized the captain of two sloops that
had come into their harbour to be freighted with
lumber, and convoyed by a king's cutter called
the 'Margaretta.' The lumber was for the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>army at Boston, and they, the Americans, got
possession of the sloops, after taking the captain,
whom they seized in the 'meeting-house.' The
'Margaretta' didn't fire on the town, but slipped
away down the harbour in the dark that night,
and the next morning sailed out to sea.</p>

<p>"Then forty men, under the command of Capt.
Jeremiah O'Brien, pursued her in one of the captured
sloops, and as she was a dull sailer, soon
overtook her. An obstinate sea-fight followed;
the captain of the cutter was mortally wounded,
six of his men not so badly, and after an hour's
fight the 'Margaretta's' flag was struck. It was
the first time the British flag was struck on the
ocean to Americans."</p>

<p>"But not the last by any means!" cried Max,
exultantly; "whatever may be said of our land
forces, America has always shown herself superior
to Great Britain on the sea. I'm very proud
of the fact that though at the beginning of the
last war with England we had but twenty vessels
(exclusive of one hundred and twenty gun-boats),
while England had ten hundred and sixty, we
whipped her."</p>

<p>"Quite true, Max," Mrs. Travilla said, smiling
at the boy's ardent patriotism, "and I am as
proud of the achievements of our navy as you
can be; but let us give all the glory to God
who helped the oppressed in their hard struggle
against their unjust and cruel oppressor."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, I know," he answered; "America
was most shamefully oppressed, and it was
only by God's help that she succeeded in putting
a stop to the dreadful treatment of her poor
sailors. Just to think of the insolent way the
British naval officers used to have of boarding
our vessels and carrying off American-born men,
who loved their own country and wanted to serve
her, and forcing them even to serve against her,
fairly makes my blood boil!" Max had in his
excitement unconsciously raised his voice so that
his words reached his father's ear.</p>

<p>The captain looked smilingly at Violet, "My
boy is an ardent patriot," he said in a pleased
tone. "Should we ever have another war (which
Heaven forbid!), I hope he will do his country
good service."</p>

<p>"I am sure he will if he lives to see that day,"
returned Violet; "but I agree with you in hoping
the need of such service will never arise."</p>

<p>"But let us always remember," Evelyn said
in reply to Max, "that those cruel, unjust deeds,
and the feelings that prompted them, were not
those of the English people, but of their Government
and the aristocracy,&mdash;I suppose because
of their hatred of republicanism, their desire to
keep the masses of the people down, and themselves
rich and powerful."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosie, "it was just pure pride
and selfishness. They didn't like the doctrine of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>our Declaration of Independence that 'all men
are created equal.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Travilla was turning over the leaves of
her book again.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Walter, "haven't you something
more to read to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, and began at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"On the ninth (of June) the 'Falcon,' a British
sloop of war, was seen from Cape Ann in chase of
two schooners bound to Salem. One of these was
taken; a fair wind wafted the other into Gloucester
harbor. Linzee, the captain of the 'Falcon,' followed
with his prize, and, after anchoring, sent his lieutenant
and thirty-six men in a whale-boat and two
barges to bring under his bow the schooner that had
escaped.</p>

<p>"As the barge men boarded her at her cabin windows,
men from the shore fired on them, killing three
and wounding the lieutenant in the thigh. Linzee
sent his prize and a cutter to cannonade the town.
They did little injury; while the Gloucester men,
with the loss of but two, took both schooners, the
barges, and every man in them, Linzee losing half his
crew."</p></div>

<p>"How vexed he must have been!" laughed
Lulu. "Did he ever go back to take revenge,
Grandma Elsie?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," she said, "though Gage
and the British admiral planned to do so, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>also to wreak vengeance on the people of Portland,&mdash;then
called Falmouth,&mdash;where, as you
probably remember, Mowat had been held prisoner
for a few hours in May of that same
year.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 16th of October Mowat
again appeared in their harbour in command of
a ship of sixteen guns, attended by three other
vessels, and at half-past nine in the morning
began firing upon the town.</p>

<p>"In five minutes several houses were in a
blaze; then a party of marines landed and
spread the conflagration. He burned down about
three fourths of the town,&mdash;a hundred and thirty
dwelling-houses, the public buildings, and a
church,&mdash;and shattered the rest of the houses
with balls and shells. The English account
makes the destruction still greater. So far north
winter begins early, and it was just at the beginning
of a severe one that he thus turned the poor
people of that town out of house and home into
the cold, in poverty and misery."</p>

<p>"That was a Christian deed worthy of a
Christian king," remarked Rosie, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Bancroft says," continued her mother, "that
the indignation of Washington was kindled by
'these savage cruelties, this new exertion of despotic
barbarity.' General Green said, 'Death
and destruction mark the footsteps of the enemy;
fight or be slaves is the American motto.'"</p>

<p>"And who wouldn't rather fight and die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>fighting, than be a slave?" cried Max, his eyes
flashing. "Grandma Elsie," he said, "you
haven't told us a word about the American navy.
Didn't they begin one about that time?"</p>

<p>"I think they did, Max," was her reply;
"but suppose we call upon your father to tell
us about it. He is doubtless better informed
than I in everything relating to that branch of
the service."</p>

<p>"Papa, will you?" asked the lad, turning
toward the Captain and raising his voice a little.</p>

<p>"Will I do what, my son?"</p>

<p>"Tell us about the doings of the navy in
Revolutionary times, sir," replied Max, "as
Grandma Elsie has been telling of the fights
on land."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, Papa; won't you?" pleaded Lulu,
hastening to his side, the other girls and Walter
following, while Max gallantly offered to move
Grandma Elsie's chair nearer to his father and
Violet, which she allowed him to do, thanking
him with one of her rarely sweet smiles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>The Captain, gently putting aside the two little
ones who were hanging lovingly about him,
saw every one seated comfortably, and near
enough to hear all he might say, then resuming
his own seat, began the account they had asked
for of the early doings of the embryo navy of
their common country.</p>

<p>"We had no navy at all when the Revolutionary
War began," he said. "Rhode Island, the
smallest State in the Union, was the first of the
colonies to move in the matter of building and
equipping a Continental fleet. On October 3,
1775, its delegates laid before Congress the instructions
they had received to do what they
could to have that work begun.</p>

<p>"They met with great opposition there; but
John Adams was very strongly in its favour, and
did for it all in his power.</p>

<p>"On the 5th of October, Washington was authorized
to employ two armed vessels to intercept
British store-ships, bound for Quebec;
on the 13th, two armed vessels, of ten and of
fourteen guns, were voted; and seventeen days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>later, two others of thirty-six guns. That was
the beginning of our navy; and it was very
necessary we should have one to protect our
seaport towns and destroy the English ships sent
against us, also to make it more difficult and
hazardous for them to bring over new levies of
troops to deprive us of our liberties, and from
using their vessels to destroy our merchantmen,
and so put an end to our commerce.</p>

<p>"Rhode Island had bold and skilful seamen,
some of whom had had something to do with
British ships before the war began,&mdash;even as
early as 1772.</p>

<p>"In that year there was a British armed
schooner called the 'Gaspee,' in Narragansett Bay,
sent there to enforce obnoxious British laws.</p>

<p>"Its officers behaved in so tyrannical a manner
toward the Americans of the neighbourhood that
at length they felt it quite unbearable; and one
dark, stormy night in June, Capt. Abraham
Whipple, a veteran sailor, with some brother
seamen, went down the bay in open whale-boats,
set the 'Gaspee' on fire, and burned her.</p>

<p>"The British Government of course wanted to
punish them, but all engaged in the work of
destruction were so true to each other that it
was impossible to find out who they were; but
three years later&mdash;in 1775, the year that the war
began&mdash;the bay was blockaded by an English
frigate, and in some way her commander learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>that Whipple had been the leader of the men
who destroyed the 'Gaspee.' He then wrote
him a note."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"You, Abraham Whipple, on the seventeenth of
June 1772, burnt his Majesty's vessel the 'Gaspee,'
and I will hang you to the yard-arm."</p></div>

<p>"Whipple replied with a note."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>To Sir James Wallace</i>:<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Always catch a man before you hang him.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
<span class="smcap">Abraham Whipple.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>"Good!" laughed Max; "and I think he
never did catch him,&mdash;did he, Papa?"</p>

<p>"No, though he made every effort to do so,
being greatly angered by the impudent reply."</p>

<p>"But you don't blame Whipple for answering
him in that way,&mdash;do you, Papa?" queried
Lulu.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do," her father said with
a slight smile. "And I think the legislature of
Rhode Island did a right and wise thing in fitting
out two armed vessels to drive Sir James and
his frigate out of Narragansett Bay, giving the
command of them, and thus the honour of firing
the first gun in the naval service of the Revolution,
to Captain Whipple."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was splendid!" cried several young
voices.</p>

<p>"That gave Washington a hint," continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>the Captain, "and he authorized the fitting out
of several vessels as privateers, manning them
with these sailor-soldiers."</p>

<p>"What is a privateer, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"A vessel belonging to some private person,
or to more than one, sailing in time of war, with
a license from Government to seize, plunder, and
destroy the vessels of the enemy, and any goods
they may carry, wherever found afloat."</p>

<p>"And how do they differ from transports,
brother Levis?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"Transports are vessels used for the carrying
of troops, stores, and materials of war," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Did they do their work well, Captain?"
asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Some did, and some did not," he answered.
"The most successful was Capt. John Manly,
who had been thirty years, or nearly that, on the
sea. He was a skilful fisherman of Marblehead,
and Washington commissioned him as captain.</p>

<p>"He was doubtless well acquainted with the
qualifications of the sailors of that part of the
coast, and knew how to select a choice crew, at
all events he was very successful in annoying the
enemy, and soon had captured three ships as they
entered Boston Harbour. One of them was laden
with just such things as were badly needed by the
Americans, then besieging Boston,&mdash;heavy guns,
mortars, and intrenching tools.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>"Manly became a terror to the British, and
they tried hard to catch him."</p>

<p>"If they had, I suppose they'd have hung him,"
remarked Lulu, half inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No doubt they would have been glad to do
so," her father replied. "They sent out an
armed schooner from Halifax to take him; but
he was too wary and skilful a commander to be
easily caught, and he went on roaming along the
seacoast of New England, taking prize after
prize from among the British ships."</p>

<p>"What was the name of his vessel, Papa?"
asked Max.</p>

<p>"The 'Lee.' It was not long before Congress
created a navy, and Manly was appointed a captain
in it. He did gallant service until he was
taken prisoner by Sir George Collier in the
'Rainbow.'"</p>

<p>"Did they hang him, Papa?" asked Gracie,
with a look of distress.</p>

<p>"No; he was kept a prisoner, first on that
vessel, then in Mill prison, Halifax, exchanged after
a while, then again taken prisoner while in
command of the 'Pomona,' held a prisoner at Barbadoes,
but made his escape and took command
of the privateer 'Jason.' He was afterward attacked
by two privateers, ran in between them,
giving both a broadside at once and making them
strike their colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Later he was chased by a British seventy-four,
and to escape capture ran his ship aground
on a sand-bar; afterward he succeeded in getting
her off, fired thirteen guns as a defiance, and
made his escape."</p>

<p>"Please tell us some more, brother Levis,"
urged Walter, as the Captain paused in his narrative;
"we'd be glad to hear all the doings of
our navy."</p>

<p>"That would make a long story indeed, my
boy," the Captain said with a smile; "longer
than could be told in one day or two. I will
try to relate some few more occurrences of particular
interest; and I advise you all to consult
history on the subject after we get home. The
coming winter will be a good time for that.</p>

<p>"In October, 1775, as I have already said,
Congress resolved that a swift sailing-vessel, to
carry ten carriage-guns and an appropriate number
of swivels, should be fitted out for a cruise
of three months for the purpose of intercepting
British transports. They also formed a Marine
Committee consisting of seven members, and
ordered another vessel to be built,&mdash;the Marine
Committee performing the duties now falling to
the share of our Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>"Later in that same year Congress ordered thirteen
more vessels to be built. They were the
'Washington,' 'Randolph,' 'Warren,' 'Hancock,'
'Raleigh,' each carrying thirty-two guns; the 'Effingham,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>'Delaware,' 'Boston,' 'Virginia,' 'Providence,'
'Montgomery,' 'Congress' and 'Trumble;'
some of these were armed with twenty-eight,
others with twenty-four guns."</p>

<p>"They made Abraham Whipple captain of one,&mdash;didn't
they, Papa?" asked Max.</p>

<p>"Yes; Nicholas Biddle, Dudly Saltonstall and
John B. Hopkins captains of the others, and
Esek Hopkins commander-in-chief. He was
considered as holding about the same rank
in the navy that Washington did in the army,
and was styled indifferently admiral or commodore.</p>

<p>"Among the first lieutenants appointed was
John Paul Jones, who became a famous commander
before the war was over,&mdash;a great
naval hero. But you have all heard of him I
think."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Rosie. "It was he who commanded
the 'Bonhomme Richard' in that hard-fought
battle with the British ship 'Serapis.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Captain. "It was one
of the most desperate conflicts on record, and
resulted in victory for Jones and the 'Bonhomme
Richard,' though she was so badly damaged,&mdash;'counters
and quarters driven in, all her
lower-deck guns dismounted, on fire in two
places, and six or seven feet of water in the hold'&mdash;that
she had to be abandoned, and sank the
next morning.</p>

<p>"Pearson the captain of the 'Serapis,' though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>defeated, had made so gallant a fight that he was
knighted by the king. When Jones heard of it
he said, 'He deserves it; and if I fall in with him
again I'll make a lord of him.'</p>

<p>"I think he&mdash;Pearson&mdash;was more gallant than
polite or generous; for on offering his sword to
Jones after his surrender he said, 'I cannot, sir,
but feel much mortification at the idea of surrendering
my sword to a man who has fought
me with a rope round his neck.'"</p>

<p>"Just like an Englishman!" exclaimed Max,
hotly; "but what did Jones say in reply,
Papa?"</p>

<p>"He returned the sword, saying, 'You have
fought gallantly, sir, and I hope your king will
give you a better ship.'"</p>

<p>"That was a gentlemanly reply," said Lulu,
"and I hope Jones got the credit he deserved
for his splendid victory."</p>

<p>"Europe and America rang with his praises,"
said her father. "The Empress of Russia gave
him the ribbon of St. Ann, the King of Denmark
a pension, and the King of France a gold-mounted
sword with the words engraved upon
its blade, 'Louis XVI., rewarder of the valiant
assertor of the freedom of the sea.' He also
made him a Knight of the Order of Merit.</p>

<p>"Nothing ever occurred afterward to dim his
fame, and he is known in history as the Chevalier
John Paul Jones."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>Just here a passing vessel attracted the attention
of the captain and the others, and it
was not until some hours later that the conversation
in regard to the doings of the navy was
resumed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Toward evening the young people again gathered
about the captain, asking that his story of
naval exploits might be continued.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he said pleasantly, "that to
recount naval exploits is the wisest thing I can
do; it stirs my blood, and revives the old love
for the service."</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, please don't ever, ever go back to
your ship and leave us!" exclaimed Gracie,
tears starting to her eyes at the very thought.</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure that I would be accepted
should I offer my services again, my
darling," he answered, drawing her into his arms
and caressing her tenderly; "but really I have
no serious thought of so doing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad of that, you dear Papa!" she
said with a sigh of relief, putting her arm about
his neck and kissing him with ardent affection.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Lulu. "I don't know what
I wouldn't rather have happen than to be parted
again for months and maybe years from my
dear father."</p>

<p>A loving look was his reply as he drew her
to his other side and caressed her with equal
tenderness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>At that little Elsie came running toward
them. "Me too, Papa," she said, "kiss me
too, and let me sit on your knee while you tell
'bout things that happened a long while ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, the baby girl has the best right to sit
on Papa's knee when she wants to," said Lulu,
good-naturedly making way for the little one.</p>

<p>A loving look and smile from her father as he
lifted the baby girl to the coveted seat and gave
her the asked for caress, amply rewarded her
little act of self-denial.</p>

<p>"I cannot begin to tell you to-day all the exploits
of our navy even during the first war with
England," the Captain said; "you will have to
read the history for yourselves, and I trust will
enjoy doing so, but I shall try to relate some of
the more prominent incidents in a way to entertain
you."</p>

<p>"What kind of flag did our naval vessels
carry at the beginning of the Revolutionary War,
Captain?" asked Evelyn. "It was not till 1777,
if my memory serves me right, that our present
flag was adopted by Congress."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," the Captain said, "and
up to that time each vessel of the little Continental
navy carried one of her own choosing; or
rather each commander was allowed to choose a
device to suit himself. It is claimed for John
Paul Jones that he raised with his own hands
the first flag of a regular American cruiser. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>vessel was Hopkins's flag-ship the 'Alfred.' It
was at Philadelphia, early in 1776 the banner
was raised. It had a white field, with the words
'Liberty Tree' in the centre above a representation
of a pine tree; beneath were the words,
'Appeal to God.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but didn't some one about that
time raise a flag composed of thirteen stripes?"
queried Eva.</p>

<p>"Quite true," replied the Captain, "and
across it a rattlesnake; underneath that, the
words, 'Don't Tread On Me.'</p>

<p>"Both Continental vessels and privateers were
very successful, and by mid-summer of 1776 they
had captured more than five hundred British
soldiers. There was a Captain Conyngham, a
brave and skilful seaman, who sailed from Dunkirk
in May, 1777, in the brig 'Surprise,' under
one of the commissions which Franklin carried
with him to France for army and navy officers.
(Those of you who have studied geography will,
I suppose, remember that Dunkirk is in the
north of France.) Conyngham was very successful;
had in a few days captured the British
packet ship 'Prince of Orange' and a brig, and
returned with them to Dunkirk. The English
ambassador at Paris complained very strongly,
and to appease the wrath of the English, the
French Government put the captain and his crew
in prison."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, what a shame!" cried Lulu.</p>

<p>Her father smiled slightly at that. "They
were not kept there very long," he said, "but
were soon released, and Conyngham allowed to
fit out another cruiser, called the 'Revenge.'"</p>

<p>"A very suitable name," laughed Max.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented his father, and went on with
his history. "The British Government had sent
two vessels to arrest Conyngham and his men
as pirates, but when they reached Dunkirk he
had already sailed. Had the British succeeded
in taking them, they would no doubt have been
hanged as pirates; for both Government and people
of Great Britain were at that time much exasperated
by the blows Americans were dealing
their dearest interest, commerce. 'The Revenge'
was doing so much injury,&mdash;making prizes of
merchantmen, and so putting money into the
hands of the American commissioners for public
use,&mdash;that the British were at their wit's end; the
people in the seaports were greatly alarmed, and
insurance on cargoes went up to twenty-five per
cent. Some of the British merchants sent out
their goods in French vessels for greater security,&mdash;so
many of them, in fact, that at one
time there were forty French vessels together in
the Thames taking in cargoes.</p>

<p>"At that time British transports were engaged
in carrying German troops across the Atlantic to
fight the Americans. Conyngham was on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>look-out for these, but did not succeed in meeting
with any of them."</p>

<p>"Such a despicable business as it was for
George III to hire those fellows to fight the
people here!" exclaimed Max. "I wish Conyngham
had caught some of them. Papa, didn't
he at one time disguise his ship and take her into
an English port to refit?"</p>

<p>"So it is said," replied the Captain; "it was
for repairs, after a storm. It is said also that
he obtained supplies at one time in an Irish
port."</p>

<p>"Didn't British ships take ours sometimes,
Papa?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "victory was not always
on the side of the Americans. The fast-sailing
British frigates captured many privateersmen and
merchantmen, and considering their great superiority
of numbers it would have been strange
indeed had that not been the case. The war on
the ocean was very destructive to both parties;
yet the Americans were, with reason, amazed and
delighted with their measure of success, astonishing
in proportion to the odds against them.</p>

<p>"During that year&mdash;1776&mdash;they had captured
three hundred and forty British vessels;
four had been burned, forty-five recaptured, and
eighteen released.</p>

<p>"It was in the fall of that year that Benedict
Arnold commanded some stirring naval operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>on Lake Champlain. In the previous spring the
British had made preparations to invade the
Champlain and Hudson valleys, hoping thus to
effect a separation between New England and the
other colonies which would naturally make it an
easier task to conquer both sections.</p>

<p>"To ward off that threatened danger the
Americans holding Ticonderoga and Crown
Point&mdash;both on the lake as you will remember&mdash;constructed
a small squadron, the command
of which was given to Arnold, who knew
more about naval affairs than any other available
person. Three schooners, one sloop, and five
gondolas were armed and manned, and with this
little squadron Arnold sailed down to the foot of
the lake and made observations.</p>

<p>"In the mean time the British had heard of
what was going on, and they, too, had prepared
a small squadron on the river Sorel, the outlet of
the lake. Their navy consisted of twenty-four
gun-boats, each armed with a field-piece or carriage-gun,
and a large flat-bottomed boat called
the 'Thunderer,' carrying heavy guns.</p>

<p>"It was not till the middle of October that the
fight took place. Arnold, with his flotilla, was
then lying between the western shore of the lake
and Valcour Island. The 'Congress' was his flag-ship.
The British attacked him, and a very severe
fight followed. It was brought to a conclusion
only by the coming of a very dark night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>The Americans had lost the 'Royal Savage' in the
action; the rest of the flotilla fled up the lake,
eluding the British in the darkness.</p>

<p>"The next morning the British followed; and
all that day and the following night the chase
continued. Early the next morning the British
succeeded in coming up with the Americans, and
another battle followed. Arnold, who was on
the galley 'Congress,' fought hard until his vessel
was nearly a wreck, then ran her and four others
into a creek and set them on fire to prevent their
falling into the hands of the foe.</p>

<p>"Those who were left of the crews escaped
and made their way to Crown Point."</p>

<p>"Arnold did do good work for his country in
the early part of the war," exclaimed Rosie. "If
he had been killed in that fight he would always
have been considered as great a patriot as any
other man of the time."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Captain with an involuntary
sigh, "if he had fallen then, or even some years
later, his memory would have been as fondly
cherished as that of almost any other soldier of
the Revolution. He would have been considered
one of the noblest champions of liberty. Ah,
what a pity he should turn traitor and make himself
the object of infamy, as lasting as the history
of his native land, which he attempted to betray
into the hands of her foes!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless after years must have brought him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>many an hour of bitter regret," said Mrs. Travilla,
echoing the Captain's sigh. "Poor fellow! I
hope he repented and was forgiven of God,
though his countrymen could never forgive him.
He had a pious mother who tried to train him
up aright, and certainly must have often prayed
earnestly for her son; so I hope he may have repented
and found forgiveness and salvation
through the atoning blood of Christ."</p>

<p>"I would be glad indeed to know that he had,
Mamma," said Violet.</p>

<p>"I too," added the Captain. "I think he
must have been a very wretched man in the latter
years of his life."</p>

<p>"Was he treated well in England, Papa?"
asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"Not by every one," replied her father;
"some of the noble-minded there showed him
very plainly that they despised him for his
treason. George III. introduced him to Earl
Balcarras, who had been with Burgoyne at the
battle of Bemis's Heights; but the earl refused
his hand, and turned on his heel saying, 'I know
General Arnold, and abominate traitors.'"</p>

<p>"How Arnold must have felt that!" exclaimed
Rosie. "I would not have liked to be in his
shoes."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said her mother. "The British
officers thoroughly despised him, and there is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>anecdote of a meeting he once had with Talleyrand
which must have been trying to his feelings,
if he had any sense of honour left.</p>

<p>"It seems that Talleyrand, who was fleeing
from France during the revolution there, inquired
at the hotel where he was at the time, for some
American who could give him letters of introduction
to persons of influence here. He was told
that an American gentleman was in an adjoining
room. It seems it was Arnold, though no one,
I suppose, knew who he was. Talleyrand sought
an interview with him, and made his request for
letters of introduction, when Arnold at once
retreated from the room, as he did so saying
with a look of pain on his face, 'I was born in
America, lived there till the prime of my life,
but, alas! I can call no man in America my
friend.'"</p>

<p>"I should feel sorry for him in spite of that
black act of treason," Violet said, "if he had not
followed it up by such infamous deeds against
his countrymen, even those of them who had
been his neighbours and friends in his early years.
I remember Lossing tells us that while New
Haven&mdash;set on fire by Arnold's band of Tories
and Hessians&mdash;was burning, he stood in the
belfry of a church watching the conflagration
with probably the same kind of satisfaction that
Nero felt in the destruction of Rome. Think of
such a murderous expedition against the home
and friends of his childhood and youth! the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>wanton destruction of a thriving town! It showed
him to be a most malicious wretch, worthy of the
scorn and contempt with which he was treated
even by many of those who had profited by his
treason."</p>

<p>"Yes; 'the way of transgressors is hard,'"
quoted her mother.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>For some days the "Dolphin" rode at anchor
in Bar Harbour, Mount Desert, while its passengers
found great enjoyment in trips here and
there about the island, visiting the Ovens, Otter
Cliffs, Schooner Head, and other points of
interest.</p>

<p>But the time was drawing near when Max
must show himself to the examiners of applicants
for cadetship in Annapolis, and early one
bright morning, a favourable land breeze springing
up, the yacht weighed anchor and started
southward.</p>

<p>They were to touch at Newport on their way
and take on board any of their party left there
who might care to visit Annapolis with them.</p>

<p>As usual all gathered upon deck shortly after
breakfast, and again the young people besieged
the Captain with requests for something more
about the doings of Revolutionary days.</p>

<p>"You know, Papa," said Lulu, "we've been
so busy visiting all those lovely places on Mount
Desert that we haven't had time for anything
about the wars since you told us how Arnold
fought the British on Lake Champlain."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, I remember," he said. "How would
you like now to hear of some of the doings
and happenings of those times in and about
Newport?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please do tell of them! We'd like
it ever so much," answered several young
voices, and the Captain good-naturedly complied.</p>

<p>"I will begin," he said, "with a bold and
brave exploit of Major Silas Talbot, in the fall
of 1778. The British had converted a strong
vessel into a galley, named it the 'Pigot,' in
honour of their general of that name, and anchored
it in the channel between the eastern side
of the island bearing the same name as the
State, and the main land. It was armed with
twelve eight-pounders and ten swivels, making
a formidable floating battery, the object of which
was to close up the channel against the French
fleet which lay off Newport.</p>

<p>"It also effectually broke up the local trade of
that section; therefore its destruction was very
desirable, and Major Talbot proposed to head
an expedition to accomplish that, or its capture.
General Sullivan thought the thing could not be
done, but finally gave consent that the effort
should be made.</p>

<p>"Sixty resolute patriots were drafted for the
purpose and on the 10th of October they set
sail in a coasting-sloop called the 'Hawk,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>armed with only three three-pounders, beside
the small arms carried by the men.</p>

<p>"They passed the British forts at Bristol Ferry
and anchored within a few miles of the 'Pigot.'
Major Talbot then procured a horse, rode down
the east bank and reconnoitred. He saw that
the 'Pigot' presented a formidable appearance,
but he was not too much alarmed thereby
to make the proposed attempt to capture her.</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock that same evening he hoisted
his anchor, and favoured by a fair wind, started
on his perilous errand. He had with him Lieutenant
Helm, of Rhode Island, with a small reinforcement.
He had also a kedge-anchor, lashed
to his jib-boom, with which to tear the nettings
of the 'Pigot.' The darkness of the night
enabled him to drift past Fogland Ferry Fort
under bare poles, without being discovered; he
then hoisted sail and ran partly under the stern
of the 'Pigot.'</p>

<p>"The sentinels hailed him, but no answer was
returned; and they fired a volley of musketry
at the 'Hawk,' which fortunately hit no one,
while her kedge-anchor tore the 'Pigot's' nettings
and grappled her, and so gave the Americans
a free passage to her deck. They poured
on it from the 'Hawk,' with loud shouts, and
drove every man from the deck except the captain.
He, in shirt and drawers, fought desperately
till he found that resistance was useless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>when he surrendered his vessel with the officers
and crew.</p>

<p>"The Americans secured the prisoners below
by coiling the cables over the hatchways, weighed
anchor, and started for the harbour of Stonington,
which they entered the next day with their prize."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Max. "I'd have liked to be
one of those brave fellows, and I hope Congress
rewarded them for their gallant deed."</p>

<p>"It did," said the Captain; "presented Talbot
with a commission of lieutenant-colonel in the
army of the United States, and complimented
both him and his men."</p>

<p>"I suppose they'd have given them some
money if they'd had it to spare," remarked
Lulu; "but of course they hadn't, because the
country was so dreadfully poor then."</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, "it was poor, and
Newport, Rhode Island, was suffering greatly
from the long-continued occupation of the British.
The people of that colony had from the
first taken a bold and determined stand in opposition
to the usurpations of King George and
his ministers, and the oppressions of their tools
in this country.</p>

<p>"In the summer of 1769 a British armed sloop,
sent there by the commissioners of customs, lay
in Narragansett Bay, she was called 'Liberty,'
certainly a most inappropriate name. Her errand
was similar to that of the 'Gaspee' about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>destruction of which I have already told you,&mdash;though
that occurred some three years later.
The commander of the 'Liberty,' was a Captain
Reid. A schooner and brig belonging to Connecticut
had been seized and brought into
Newport; also the clothing and the sword of the
captain, Packwood, commander of the brig, had
been taken, and carried aboard the 'Liberty.'
He went there to recover them, was badly maltreated,
and as he left the sloop in his boat,
was fired upon with a musket and a brace of
pistols.</p>

<p>"This occurrence greatly exasperated the people
of Newport, who demanded of Reid that the
man who had fired upon Captain Packwood
should be sent ashore.</p>

<p>"Reid again and again sent the wrong man,
which of course exasperated the people, and they
determined to show him that they were not to be
trifled with. Accordingly, a number of them
boarded the 'Liberty,' cut her cables, and set her
adrift. The tide carried her down the bay and
drifted her to Goat Island, where the people,
after throwing her stores and ammunition into the
water, scuttled her, and set her on fire. Her
boats were dragged to the common, and burned
there."</p>

<p>"Was she entirely burned, Papa?" asked
Gracie.</p>

<p>"Almost, after burning for several days."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>"And that was nearly six years before the
battle of Lexington," Evelyn remarked in a half
musing tone. "How wonderfully patient and
forbearing the Americans were, putting up for
years with so much of British insolence and
oppression!"</p>

<p>"I think they were," responded the Captain.
"Nor was it from cowardice, as they plainly
showed when once war with Great Britain was
fairly inaugurated.</p>

<p>"And the little State of Rhode Island had her
full share in the struggle and the suffering it
brought. Let us see what Bancroft says in regard
to the action of her citizens at the beginning
of the conflict, immediately after the battles
of Lexington and Concord," he added, taking up
and opening a book lying near at hand. All
waited in silence as he turned over the leaves and
began to read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The nearest towns of Rhode Island were in motion
before the British had finished their retreat. At the
instance of Hopkins and others, Wanton, the governor,
though himself inclined to the royal side, called an
assembly. Its members were all of one mind; and
when Wanton, with several of the council, showed
hesitation, they resolved, if necessary, to proceed alone.
The council yielded and confirmed the unanimous vote
of the assembly for raising an army of fifteen hundred
men. 'The colony of Rhode Island,' wrote Bowler, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>speaker, to the Massachusetts congress, 'is firm and determined;
and a greater unanimity in the lower house
scarce ever prevailed.' Companies of the men of
Rhode Island preceded this early message."</p></div>

<p>"The little State took a noble stand," remarked
Violet, as her husband finished reading
and closed the book.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and their consequent sufferings
from British aggressions promptly began.
Admiral Wallace, an inhuman wretch, that summer
commanded a small British fleet lying in
Newport harbour. It was he who promised to
hang Abraham Whipple, but never caught him.
It was discovered by the Americans that he
(Wallace) was planning to carry off the livestock
from the lower end of the island to supply
the British army at Boston."</p>

<p>"Going to steal them, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"Yes; but the people were too quick for him.
Some of them went down one dark night in
September and brought off a thousand sheep and
fifty head of cattle; and three hundred minute-men
drove a good many more to Newport, so
saving them from being taken by Wallace and
his men.</p>

<p>"Wallace was very angry, ordered the people
to make contributions to supply his fleet with
provisions, and to force them to do so took care
to prevent them from getting their usual supplies
of fuel and provisions from the mainland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>
<p>"The people were much alarmed, and about
half of them left the town. Shortly afterward
a treaty was made by which they engaged
to supply the fleet with provisions and beer,
and Wallace allowed them to move about as
they pleased. But soon, however, he demanded
three hundred sheep of the people of Bristol,
and upon their refusal to comply, bombarded
their town.</p>

<p>"He began the bombardment about eight o'clock
in the evening. The rain was pouring in torrents;
and the poor women and children fled
through the darkness and storm, out to the open
fields to escape from the flying shot and shell of
the invaders."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful for the poor things!" exclaimed
Gracie.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was great suffering among them,"
replied her father. "The house of Governor
Bradford was burned, as also were many others.
Wallace played the pirate in Narragansett Bay
for a month, wantonly destroying the people's
property, seizing every American vessel that
entered Newport harbour and sending it to Boston,&mdash;which,
as you will remember, was then
occupied by the British general, Gage, and his
troops,&mdash;plundering and burning all the dwellings
on the beautiful island of Providence, and
all the buildings near the ferry at Canonicut.</p>

<p>"He kept possession of the harbour till the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>spring of 1776; but in April of that year some
American troops came to try to drive him away.
Captain Grimes brought two row-galleys, each
carrying two eighteen-pounders, from Providence.
Provincial troops brought two more
eighteen-pounders and planted them on shore
where the British, who were anchored about a
mile above Newport, could see them.</p>

<p>"Wallace evidently thought the danger too
great and immediate, for he weighed anchor, and
with his whole squadron sailed out of the harbour
without firing a shot."</p>

<p>"He must have been a coward like most men
who revel in such cruelty," remarked Max sagely.
"Not much like the Wallace of Scotland who
fought the English so bravely in early times."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you in that thought,
Max," his father said with a slight smile. "This
Wallace was the same who, later in the war,
plundered and destroyed the property of the
Americans on the Hudson, desolating the farms
of innocent men because they preferred freedom
to the tyrannical rule of the English government,
and laying the town of Kingston in ashes.</p>

<p>"Soon after he sailed out of Narragansett
Bay another British vessel called the 'Glasgow,'
carrying twenty-nine guns, came into the harbour
and anchored near Fort Island. She had just
come out of a severe fight with some American
vessels, held the same day that Wallace left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>Newport. Probably her officers thought he was
still there so that their vessel would be safe in
that harbour, but they soon discovered their mistake.
The Americans threw up a breast-work
on Brenton's Point, placed some pieces of heavy
artillery there, and the next morning opened upon
her and another vessel so vigorous a fire from
their battery that they soon cut their cables and
went out to sea again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>"Had the land troops of the British gone
away also, Captain?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "Early in May the British
troops left the houses of the town and returned
to their camp. It was some relief to
the poor, outraged people whose dwellings had
been turned into noisy barracks, their pleasant
groves, beautiful shade-trees and broad forests
destroyed, their property taken from them, their
wives and children exposed to the profanity, low
ribaldry, and insults of the ignorant and brutal
soldiery; but there was by no means entire relief;
they were still plundered and insulted.</p>

<p>"Clinton had gone to New York with about one
half the troops, but a far worse tyrant held command
in his place, Major-General Prescott by
name; he was a dastardly coward when in danger,
the meanest of petty tyrants when he felt it
safe to be such, narrow minded, hard hearted
and covetous,&mdash;anything but a gentleman. A
more unfit man for the place could hardly have
been found.</p>

<p>"When he saw persons conversing together as
he walked the streets, he would shake his cane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>at them and call out, 'Disperse, ye rebels!'
Also, he would command them to take off their
hats to him, and unless his order was instantly
obeyed, enforce it by a rap with his cane."</p>

<p>"That must have been hard indeed to bear,"
remarked Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Max hotly. "I'd have enjoyed
knocking him down."</p>

<p>"Probably better than the consequences of
your act," laughed his father; then went on:
"Prescott was passing out of town one evening,
going to his country quarters, when he overtook
a Quaker, who of course did not doff his hat.
Prescott was on horseback; he dashed up to the
Quaker, pressed him up against a stone wall,
knocked off his hat, and then put him under
guard.</p>

<p>"He imprisoned many citizens of Newport without
giving any reason. One was a man named
William Tripp, a very respectable citizen, who
had a wife and a large and interesting family,
with none of whom was he allowed to hold any
communication.</p>

<p>"But Tripp's wife had contrivance enough
to open a correspondence with her husband by
sending him a loaf of bread with a letter baked
in the inside. Whether he could find means to
send a reply I do not know, but it must have
been some consolation to hear from her and his
children.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>
<p>"While Tripp was still in prison she tried to
see Prescott, to beg that her husband might be
set free, or she allowed a personal interview with
him. She was told to come again the next day.
Her application had been made to a Captain
Savage, the only person through whom she might
hope to gain the coveted interview with Prescott;
but when she again went to him, at the appointed
time, he treated her very roughly, refusing her
request to see the general, and as he shut the
door violently in her face, telling her with fiendish
exultation that he expected her husband would
be hung as a rebel in less than a week."</p>

<p>"Truly, his was a most appropriate name,"
remarked Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p>"And did they hang the poor man, Papa?"
asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"I do not know, my darling," he answered,
"but I hope not. Would you all like to hear
something more about his persecutor, Prescott?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes," came promptly from several
young voices.</p>

<p>"You may be sure," the Captain went on,
"that the people of Newport grew very tired of
their oppressor, and devised various plans for
ridding themselves of him. None of these proved
successful, but at length a better one was contrived
and finally carried out by Lieutenant-Colonel
Barton, of Providence. Lossing speaks
of it as one of the boldest and most hazardous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>enterprizes undertaken during the war. It was
accomplished on the night of the 10th of July,
1777.</p>

<p>"At that time Prescott was quartered at
the house of a Quaker named Overing, about
five miles above Newport, on the west road
leading to the ferry, at the north part of the
island.</p>

<p>"Barton's plan was to cross the bay under
cover of the darkness, seize Prescott, and carry
him off to the American camp. But it was a very
dangerous thing to attempt, because three British
frigates, with their guard-boats, were lying in the
bay almost in front of Overing's house. But
taking with him a few chosen men, in four whale-boats,
with muffled oars, Barton embarked from
Warwick Point at nine o'clock, passed silently
between the islands of Prudence and Patience
over to Rhode Island, hearing on the way the cry
of the British sentries from their guard-boats,
'All's well.'</p>

<p>"They&mdash;the Americans&mdash;landed in Coddington's
Cove, at the mouth of a small stream which
passed by Overing's. Barton divided his men
into several squads, and assigned to each its
station and duty. Then in the strictest order
and profound silence they made their way to the
house, the larger portion of them passing between
a British guard-house and the encampment
of a company of light-horse, while the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>party were to reach the same point by a circuitous
route, approaching it from the rear, then
to secure the doors.</p>

<p>"As Barton and his men drew near the
gate they were hailed by a sentinel stationed
there. He hailed them twice, and then demanded
the countersign. Barton answered,
'We have no countersign to give,' then
quickly asked, 'Have you seen any deserters
here to-night?'</p>

<p>"That query allayed the sentinel's suspicions,
so putting him off his guard, and the next moment
he found himself seized, bound, and
threatened with instant death if he attempted to
give the alarm.</p>

<p>"While Barton and his party had been thus
engaged the division from the rear had secured
the doors, and Barton now walked boldly into the
front passage and on into a room where he found
Mr. Overing, seated alone, reading, the rest
of the family having already retired to their
beds.</p>

<p>"Barton asked for General Prescott's room,
and Overing silently pointed to the ceiling, intimating
that it was directly overhead. Barton
then walked quietly up the stairs, four strong
white men and a powerful negro named Sisson,
accompanying him. He gently tried Prescott's
door, but found it locked. There was no time to
be lost; the negro drew back a couple of paces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>and using his head for a battering-ram, burst open
the door at the first effort.</p>

<p>"Prescott, who was in bed, thought the intruders
were robbers, and springing out, seized
his gold watch which hung upon the wall. But
Barton, gently laying a hand on his shoulder,
said, 'You are my prisoner, sir, and perfect
silence is your only safety.'</p>

<p>"Prescott asked to be allowed to dress, but
Barton refused, saying there was not time; for
he doubtless felt that every moment of delay was
dangerous to himself and his companions, and as
it was a hot July night there was no need for his
prisoner to fear taking cold. He therefore threw
a cloak about him, placed him and his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aide</i>, Major
Barrington (who, hearing a noise in the general's
room, had taken the alarm and leaped from a
window to make his escape, but only to be captured
by the Americans) between two armed men,
hurried them to the shore where the boats were
in waiting, and quickly carried them over the
water to Warwick Point. When they reached
there Prescott ventured to break the silence that
had been imposed upon him by saying to Colonel
Barton, 'Sir, you have made a bold push to-night.'</p>

<p>"'We have been fortunate,' replied Barton
coolly.</p>

<p>"Prescott and Barrington were then placed
in a coach which Captain Elliott had waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>there for them, and taken to Providence, arriving
there about sunrise."</p>

<p>"I wonder," remarked Lulu, "if Prescott
received the harsh treatment from our men that
he deserved."</p>

<p>"No," replied her father, "I am proud to be
able to say that American officers rarely, if ever,
treated their prisoners with anything like the
harshness and cruelty usually dealt out by the
British to theirs. Prescott was kindly treated
by General Spencer and his officers, and shortly
after his capture was sent to Washington's headquarters
at Middlebrook, on the Raritan.</p>

<p>"But it seems that at a tavern on the way he
received something better suited to his deserts.
At Lebanon a Captain Alden kept a tavern, and
there Prescott and his escort stopped to dine.
While they were at the table Mrs. Alden brought
on a dish of succotash."</p>

<p>"What's that, Papa?" queried little Elsie,
who had climbed to her favourite seat upon her
father's knee.</p>

<p>"Corn and beans boiled together," he replied;
"a dish that is quite a favourite with most
people in that part of the country; but was, I
presume, quite new to Prescott, and he exclaimed
indignantly, 'What! do you treat me
with the food of hogs?' Then taking the dish
from the table he strewed its contents over the
floor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>"Some one presently carried the news of his
doings to Captain Alden, and he walked into the
dining-room armed with a horse-whip and gave
Prescott a severe flogging."</p>

<p>"I think it served him right," remarked Lulu,
"for his insolence, and for wasting good food
that somebody else would have been glad to
eat."</p>

<p>"Prescott must surely have been very badly
brought up," said Rosie, "and was anything
but a gentleman. I pity the poor Newport people
if he was ever restored to his command
there. Was he, brother Levis? I really have
quite forgotten."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for them, he was," replied the
Captain. "He was exchanged for General
Charles Lee the next April, and returned to his
former command.</p>

<p>"While he was still there the Newport people
sent a committee&mdash;Timothy Folger, William
Rotch and Dr. Tupper&mdash;to him to arrange
some matters concerning the town. They
found some difficulty in gaining an interview;
and when at length Folder and the doctor
succeeded in so doing, Prescott stormed so
violently at the former that he was compelled
to withdraw.</p>

<p>"After the doctor had told his errand and
Prescott had calmed down, he asked, 'Wasn't
my treatment of Folger very uncivil?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>"The doctor answered in the affirmative, and
Prescott went on to say, 'I will tell you the
reason; he looked so much like a Connecticut
man that horse-whipped me that I could not
endure his presence.'"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>There was time for only a brief stay in the
cottages near Newport before the "Dolphin"
must sail for Annapolis, in order that Max might
be there in season for the examination of applicants
for cadetship in the United States Navy.
He had not changed his mind, but was looking
forward with delight to the life that seemed to
be opening before him; for he loved the sea, and
thought no profession could be more honourable
than that chosen by his father, who was in his
eyes the impersonation of all that was noble,
good, and wise.</p>

<p>He was not sorry that his suspense in regard
to acceptance would soon be ended, though both
he and the other young people of the party
would have liked to visit places in the neighbourhood
of Newport made memorable by the occurrence
of events in the Revolutionary War; but
the Captain encouraged the hope that they would
all be able to do so at some future time; also
said they would find at Annapolis some souvenirs
of the struggle for independence quite as well
worth attention as those they were for the present
leaving behind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>So they started upon their southward way in
excellent spirits, Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore accompanying
them.</p>

<p>On the first evening of their renewed voyage
the young people gathered around the Captain
and begged for some account of Revolutionary
occurrences in the State they were now about to
visit.</p>

<p>"I will go back a little further than that," he
said pleasantly, drawing Gracie to a seat upon
his knee,&mdash;"to the action of the people of Maryland
upon hearing of the passage of the Stamp
Act. In August, 1765, there was a meeting at
Annapolis of the 'Assertors of British American
privileges' held 'to show their detestation of
and abhorrence to some late tremendous attacks
on liberty, and their dislike to a certain late
arrived officer, a <em>native of this province</em>.'</p>

<p>"The person to whom they referred was a Mr.
Hood, who had been appointed stamp-master
while in England shortly before. Dr. Franklin
had recommended him for the place; but the
people were so angry that no one would buy
goods of him, though offered at a very low price.
He learned that they intended to give him a coat
of tar and feathers, but escaped to New York in
time to save himself from that.</p>

<p>"As they couldn't catch him they made an
effigy of him, dressed it oddly, put it in a cart,
like a malefactor, with some sheets of paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>before it, and paraded it through the town, the
bell tolling all the while. They then took it to
a hill, punished it at the whipping post and
pillory, hung it on the gibbet, then set fire to a
tar-barrel underneath and burned it."</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Gracie, "how dreadful if it
had been the man himself!"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't, Gracie dear," laughed Lulu;
"and if it had been, I'm not sure it was worse
than he deserved."</p>

<p>"But I suppose they had to use the stamps
for all that,&mdash;hadn't they?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"The people refused to use them, and for a
time all business was at an end," said the Captain,
going on with his narrative. "Governor
Sharpe sent back some of the stamped paper
which arrived in December, informing the colonial
secretary of the proceedings of the people,
and said that if they got hold of any stamped
paper they would be pretty sure to burn it.</p>

<p>"On the 31st of October the 'Maryland
Gazette' appeared in mourning, and said, 'The
times are Dreadful, Dismal, Doleful, Dolorous
and Dollarless.' On the 10th of December the
editor issued 'an apparition of the late "Maryland
Gazette,"' and expressed his opinion that
the odious Stamp Act would never be carried
into effect.</p>

<p>"There was great rejoicing when the intelligence
reached Annapolis that the Act had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>repealed. There were many manifestations of
mirth and festivity; but, as you all know, that
rejoicing was short-lived, for the king and his
ministers continued their aggressions upon the
liberties of the American people.</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1774 the people of Annapolis
were greatly excited over the Boston Port
Bill, and ripe for rebellion. They also resolved
that no tea should be landed on their shores;
and when on Saturday, October 15, the ship
'Peggy,' Captain Stewart, arrived from London,
bringing among other things, seventeen
packages of tea, the citizens were summoned to
a general meeting.</p>

<p>"It was the first arrival of tea since it had
become a proscribed article. It was ascertained
that it was consigned to T. C. Williams &amp; Co.,
of Annapolis, that they had imported it, and
that Antony Stewart, proprietor of the vessel,
had paid the duty on it. This the meeting
looked upon as an acknowledgement of the right
claimed by King and Parliament to tax the tea
brought to the colonies, and it was resolved not
to permit the tea to be landed.</p>

<p>"The people of the surrounding country were
summoned to a meeting in the city, to be held on
the following Wednesday. Mr. Stewart published
a handbill of explanation of his connection
with the affair, saying that he had no intention
of violating the non-importation pledges, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>regretted that the article had been placed on
board his ship.</p>

<p>"But the people had been deceived on former
occasions, and knew that when men got into
trouble they were apt to whine and pretend innocence;
therefore they were more disposed to
punish than forgive Mr. Stewart, and at their
Wednesday meeting resolved to destroy the vessel
with its packages of tea.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Stewart, by the advice of some of
his friends, decided to destroy the vessel and the
tea himself, and did so. He ran the ship aground
near Windmill Point and set her on fire. That
satisfied the people and the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>"A historian of the time says, 'the destruction
of tea at Boston has acquired renown as an
act of unexampled daring, but the tea burning
of Annapolis, which occurred the ensuing fall,
far surpassed it in the apparent deliberation,
and utter carelessness of concealment, attending
the bold measures which led to its accomplishment.'"</p>

<p>"Did the Americans hold any other such 'tea
parties,' Papa?" asked Lulu with a humorous
look.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "in New York and New
Jersey; but I will reserve the stories of those
doings for another time, and go on now with
what occurred in Maryland,&mdash;principally at Annapolis,&mdash;in
the times now under consideration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>"There was a small tea-burning at Elizabethtown&mdash;now
called Hagerstown,&mdash;the Committee
of Vigilance obliging a man named John Parks to
go with his hat off and a lighted torch in his
hand and set fire to a chest of tea in his possession.
The committee also recommended entire
non-intercourse with Parks; but that did not
seem sufficient to the people, and they added to
it the breaking of his doors and windows. It
is said too, that tar and feathers were freely
used in various places.</p>

<p>"Maryland was not ready quite so soon as
some of the other colonies to declare herself free
and independent; but Charles Carroll, William
Paca, Samuel Chase, and others, called county
conventions, and used their influence to persuade
their fellow-citizens of the wisdom and necessity
of such a course, and on the 28th of June, the
Maryland Convention empowered their delegates
to concur with the other colonies in a declaration
of independence.</p>

<p>"As you all know, that declaration was drawn
up and signed by Congress shortly afterward, and
the men whose names I have mentioned were all
among the signers."</p>

<p>"Was there any fighting in or about Annapolis,
Papa?" asked Lulu.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "but it was frequently the scene
of military displays."</p>

<p>"I'd have liked that a great deal better if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>had been there," remarked Gracie. "But won't
you please tell us about them, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I will," he answered, smiling upon her and
softly smoothing her hair. "Washington passed
through Annapolis on his way northward after
the battle of Yorktown, which, as you will all
remember, virtually ended our struggle for independence,
though there was still fighting going
on in different parts of the country. Business
was suspended in Annapolis when Washington
was known to be coming, and the people crowded
streets and windows to gain a sight of the chief
as he passed. A public address was made him,
and everything done to show their appreciation,
respect, and esteem.</p>

<p>"Again he was there when, the war at an
end, he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief
of the American forces.</p>

<p>"'The State House at Annapolis, now venerated
because of the associations which cluster
around it, was filled with the brave, the fair,
and the patriotic of Maryland, to witness the
sublime spectacle of that beloved chief resigning
his military power wielded with such mighty
energy and glorious results for eight long years
into the hands of the civil authority which gave
it,' says Lossing."</p>

<p>"But why did Washington go to Maryland to
do that, Papa?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"Because the Continental Congress was then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>in session there," replied her father. "It was
a most interesting scene which then took place in
the Senate Chamber of the Capitol. The time
was noon of the 23d of December, 1783. Beside
the congressmen there were present the
governor, council and legislature of Maryland,
general officers, and the representative of France.
Places were assigned to all these, while spectators
filled the galleries and crowded the floor.</p>

<p>"Bancroft tells, us that 'rising with dignity,
Washington spoke of the rectitude of the common
cause; the support of Congress; of his country-men;
of Providence; and he commended the interests
of our dearest country to the care of Almighty
God. Then saying that he had finished the
work assigned him to do, he bade an affectionate
farewell to the august body under whose orders he
had so long acted, resigned with satisfaction the
commission which he had accepted with diffidence,
and took leave of public life. His emotion was
so great that, as he advanced and delivered up
his commission, he seemed unable to have uttered
more.'</p>

<p>"Washington still stood while the president of
Congress, turning pale from emotion, made a
short address in reply, only a sentence or two of
which I will quote:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Having taught a lesson useful to those who inflict
and those who feel oppression, with the blessings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>your fellow-citizens you retire from the great field of
action; but the glory of your virtues will continue to
animate remotest ages. We join you in commending
the interests of our dearest country to the protection
of Almighty God, beseeching him to dispose the hearts
and minds of its citizens to improve the opportunity
afforded them of becoming a happy and respectable
nation."</p></div>

<p>"Which I think we have become," added Max,
with satisfaction, as his father paused in his
narrative.</p>

<p>"By God's blessing upon the work of our
pious forefathers," added the Captain, with a look
of mingled gratitude and pride in the land of his
birth.</p>

<p>"I think we must all visit the State House when
in Annapolis," remarked Grandma Elsie, who
sat near and had been listening with almost as
keen interest as that shown by the younger ones.</p>

<p>"Certainly we must," said Mr. Dinsmore.
"Some of us have been there before, but a
second visit will not prove uninteresting, especially
along with the young folks, to whom it
will be quite new," and he glanced smilingly
around upon the bright, eager faces.</p>

<p>His suggestion was followed by expressions
of pleasure in the prospect. Then the Captain
was besieged with entreaties that he would go on
with his account of things of historical interest
to be found in Annapolis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is the little gallery in which Mrs.
Washington and other ladies stood to witness the
scene I have tried to describe," he continued. "It
is said to be unchanged, as are also the doors, windows,
cornices, and other architectural belongings.
I confess it sent a thrill through me when I first
saw them all, to think they were the very same
which echoed the voice of the Father of his Country
on that memorable occasion.</p>

<p>"Also the very spot where Mifflin, the president,
and Thomson, the secretary, of Congress
sat when the treaty of peace with Great Britain
was ratified, can be pointed out to the interested
observer, which I certainly was."</p>

<p>"It is a fine building," remarked Mr. Dinsmore,
"much admired for its style of architecture
and the beauty of its situation."</p>

<p>"It is indeed," assented the Captain. "It is
built of brick, has a fine dome, surmounted by
two smaller ones, with a cupola of wood. As
it stands upon an elevation in the centre of the
city, there is a magnificent prospect from its
dome. One sees the city and harbour, while far
away to the southeast stretches Chesapeake Bay,
with Kent Island and the eastern shore looming
up in the distance."</p>

<p>"I remember two incidents which I have
heard were connected with the building of that
State House," remarked Mrs. Dinsmore. "One
is, that when the corner-stone was laid by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Governor Eden, just as he struck it with a mallet
a severe clap of thunder burst over the city out
of a clear sky; the other, that the man who
executed the stucco-work of the dome, fell from
the scaffold and was killed just as he had completed
his centre-piece."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Captain said, "I have heard those
incidents were traditional, but am not able to
vouch for their truth."</p>

<p>"Is there not a portrait of Washington there?"
asked Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her husband, "in the House
of Delegates; it is a full-length likeness, and he is
attended by La Fayette and Colonel Tilghman,
the Continental army passing in review. It
was painted by Peale as commemorative of the
surrender at Yorktown, having been ordered by
the Assembly of Maryland.</p>

<p>"There are also full-length portraits of Carroll,
Stone, Paca, and Chase on the walls of the
Senate Chamber. The first two were painted by
Sully, the other two by Bordley,&mdash;both
native artists. There is also a full-length portrait
of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, in
Roman costume. Peale painted that also, and
presented it to Maryland, his native State, in
1794. The work was done in England, and is
of a high order.</p>

<p>"The only other portrait I recollect as being
there is one of John Eager Howard, who, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>doubtless remember, was one of the heroes of
the Revolution."</p>

<p>Favourable winds and weather enabled the
"Dolphin" to reach her destination a day or
two earlier than the Captain had expected, so
giving our party a little more time for sight-seeing
than they had hoped for. They made good
use of it, going about and visiting all the places
of interest. Almost the first that received their
attention was the State House, with its mementos
of the Revolutionary days, of which the
Captain had been telling them.</p>

<p>They lingered long over the portraits and in
the Senate Chamber, where the Father of his
Country had resigned his commission as commander-in-chief
of the Continental armies.</p>

<p>They ascended to the cupola also, and gazed
with delight upon the beautiful landscape spread
out at their feet,&mdash;Max manifesting great interest
in the vessels lying in the harbour, particularly
the practice-ship "Constellation" and the school-ship
"Santee," and scarcely less in the monitor
"Passaic" and the steam-sloop "Wyoming,"
swinging at their anchorage in the river.</p>

<p>"Papa, can I visit them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, I hope to take you to see them
all," was the pleasant-toned reply. "I intend
that you and all the party shall see everything
that is worth their attention."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, Captain," remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Evelyn in a lively tone. "I for one am very
desirous to see the Naval Academy, its grounds
and the drills,&mdash;one at least. I so enjoyed
seeing those on Gardiner's Island."</p>

<p>"You shall," replied the Captain, with his
pleasant smile. "It will give me pleasure to
take any of you who wish to go."</p>

<p>"I think that will be all of us," remarked
Violet, with a bright and happy glance up into
her husband's face.</p>

<p>They were descending the stairs as they talked,
and presently had all passed out into the State
House grounds. There they met a gentleman in
undress naval uniform who, coming forward with
a look of extreme pleasure, warmly grasped the
hand of Captain Raymond, calling him by name,
and saying, "I do not know when I have had
so agreeable a surprise."</p>

<p>The Captain returned the salutation as warmly
as it was given, then introduced the rest of his
party, telling them that this friend of his was
commander-commandant of cadets.</p>

<p>At that Max's eyes opened very wide and
fixed themselves upon the gentleman with as
eager interest as if he had been a king.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond noted it with a look of
mingled amusement and pride in the lad.</p>

<p>"This is my son Max, sir, a candidate for
cadetship," he said, laying a hand affectionately
upon Max's shoulder, "and I see he is much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>interested in this his first sight of one who will,
he hopes, soon be his commander."</p>

<p>"Ah! a son of yours, Raymond? But I
might have guessed it from his striking likeness
to his father," the commandant said in a pleased
and interested tone, grasping the boy's hand
warmly as he spoke. "I have little doubt that
he will pass," he added with a smile, "for he
should inherit a good mind, and he looks bright
and intelligent,&mdash;his father's son mentally as
well as physically."</p>

<p>Max coloured with pleasure. "It is exactly
what I want to be, sir," he said,&mdash;"as like my
father as possible." And his eyes sought that
father's face with a look of love and reverence
that was pleasant to see.</p>

<p>The Captain met it with a smile of fatherly
affection. "One's children are apt to be partial
judges," he said; then changing the subject of
conversation, he stated the desire of those under
his escort to see the Naval Academy and the
Naval vessels lying at anchor in the harbour.</p>

<p>The commandant, saying he had some hours
at his disposal, undertook to be their escort;
and thus they saw everything under the most
favourable auspices.</p>

<p>The drill of the artillery battalion seemed to
Max and Lulu very similar to that they had
witnessed at West Point, but was scarcely the
less exciting and interesting. They watched it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>all with sparkling eyes and eager, animated
looks, Max hoping soon to take part in it, and
not at all regretting his choice of a profession.
He was not a bashful lad, though by no means
conceited or forward, and his father had assured
him that if he retained his self-possession, not
giving way to nervousness or fright, he was fully
competent to pass.</p>

<p>The boy had unbounded confidence in his
father's word, which helped him to so fully retain
his self-possession that he found little or no
difficulty in answering every question put to him,&mdash;for
the Captain had been very careful to drill
him perfectly, making him thorough in all the
branches required,&mdash;and passed most successfully.</p>

<p>He was also pronounced by the examining
physician physically sound and of robust constitution.
He was accepted, took the oath of allegiance,
and felt himself several inches taller than
before.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond attended to all the business
matters, saw the room and room-mate selected for
his son, and did all that could be done to secure
the boy's comfort and welfare. The parting from
Mamma Vi, his sisters, and baby brother was
quite hard for the lad's affectionate heart, but he
managed to go through it almost without shedding
tears, though one or two would come when
Gracie clung weeping about his neck; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>last, the final farewell to his father, was hardest
of all. In vain he reminded himself that it
was not a final separation, that he might hope
for long visits at home at some future time, that
letters would pass frequently between them, and
a visit be paid him now and then by that dearly
loved, honoured, and revered parent; just now he
could only remember that the daily, hourly intercourse
he had found so delightful was over,
probably forever in this world.</p>

<p>The Captain read it all in his boy's speaking
countenance, and deeply sympathized with his
son; indeed his own heart was heavy over the
thought that this, his first-born and well-beloved
child was now to pass from under his protecting
care and try the world for himself. He felt that
he must bestow upon him a few more words of
loving, fatherly counsel.</p>

<p>They were leaving together the hotel where
the remainder of their party were domiciled for
the present. "Max, my son," he said kindly,
looking at his watch as he spoke, "we have still
more than an hour to spend as we like before you
must be at the Academy. Shall we spend it on
board the yacht?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if you can spare the time to me,"
answered the lad, making a great effort to speak
brightly and cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Then we will go there," the Captain said,
giving his son an affectionate look and smile. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>can find no better use for the next hour than devoting
it to a little talk with my first-born, on
whom I have built so many hopes."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were sitting side by
side in the "Dolphin's" cabin, no human creature
near to see or overhear what might pass between
them.</p>

<p>For a little while there was silence, each busy
with his own thoughts. It was Max who ended
it at last.</p>

<p>"Papa," he said brokenly, his hand creeping
into his father's, "you&mdash;you have been such a
good, <em>good</em> father to me; and&mdash;and I want to
be a credit and comfort to you. I"&mdash;</p>

<p>But there he broke down completely, and the
next moment&mdash;neither ever knew exactly how it
came about&mdash;he was sobbing in his father's arms.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish I'd been a better boy, Papa," he
went on, "it 'most breaks my heart to think
now of the pain and trouble I've given you at
times."</p>

<p>"My boy, my dear, dear boy," the Captain
said in moved tones, pressing the lad to his
heart, "you have been a great joy and comfort
to me for years past, and words would fail me to
tell how dear you are to your father's heart. It
seems scarcely longer ago than yesterday that I
first held my dear boy in my arms, and prayed
God that if his life was spared he might grow up
into a good, useful, Christian man, a blessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>to his parents, to the church, and to the world.
Oh, my boy, never be afraid or ashamed to own
yourself one who fears God and tries to keep his
commandments, who loves Jesus, trusts in Him
for salvation from sin and death, and tries to
honour Him in all his words and ways. Strive to
keep very near to the Master, Max, and to honour
Him in all things. Never be ashamed to own
yourself His disciple, His servant, and Him as
your Lord and King. Remember His words,
'Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and
of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation,
of him shall also the Son of man be ashamed
when He cometh in the glory of His Father with
the holy angels.' Doubtless it will at times bring
the ridicule of your companions upon you, but he
is only a coward who can not bear that when undeserved;
and what is it compared to Christ's
sufferings on the cross for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, nothing, nothing at all compared
to what Jesus bore for me! He will give me
strength to be faithful in confessing Him before
men, and your prayers will help me, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, and you may be sure that
you will be ever on your father's heart, which
will be often going up in prayer to God for a
blessing on his absent son. It is to me a joyful
thought that He is the hearer and answerer
of prayer, and will be ever near my son, to
keep him in the hour of trial and temptation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>though I may know nothing of his danger or
distress.</p>

<p>"Let us kneel down now and ask Him to be
your guard and guide through all life's journey,
to help you to be His faithful servant in all
things, and to bring you safe to heaven at last."</p>

<p>They knelt side by side, and in a few well
chosen words the Captain commended his beloved
son to the care, the guardianship, and the
guidance of the God of his fathers, asking that
he might be a faithful follower of Jesus through
all life's journey, and afterward spend an eternity
of bliss in that happy land where sin and
sorrow and partings are never known.</p>

<p>A hearty embrace followed, some few more
words of fatherly counsel and advice, then they
left the vessel, wended their way to the Naval
Academy and parted for the time, the Captain
comforting the heart of the more than half homesick
lad with the promise of a visit from him at
no very distant day and frequent letters in the
mean time.</p>

<p>The "Dolphin" was to sail northward again
that evening; and as Max watched his father out
of sight it required a mighty effort to keep back
the tears from his eyes at the thought that he
should behold that noble form and dearly loved
face no more for months or&mdash;"Oh, who could
say that some accident might not rob him forever
of his best and dearest earthly friend?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>But he struggled with himself, turned resolutely
about, and entered into lively chat with
some of his new comrades, all the while the
cheering thought in his heart that nothing could
separate him from the presence and loving care of
his heavenly Father; also that he surely would
be permitted, before many months had passed,
to see again the dear earthly one he so loved
and honoured. And in the meanwhile he was
resolved to do everything in his power to win
that father's approbation, and make him proud
and happy in his first-born son.</p>
